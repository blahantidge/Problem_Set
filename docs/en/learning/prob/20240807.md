Today's quiz is based on Audrey Grant Improving Your Judgment 1: Opening the Bidding - Opening at the One Level, Third and Fourth Position: Part 2.

<Badge type="danger" text="Bid"/>

## Introduction

The first step in valuing a hand is to look at the high-card points and distribution, but the process doesn't stop there. Your judgment, and results, will improve when you take other factors into account. Here are tips to help you make better choices when opening the bidding in third or fourth position.

### Tip #1 - Keep the Goal in Mind

It's easy to fall into the trap of simply counting to 12 and then
opening the bidding. A better approach is to keep the objective in
mind.

Compare this hand

<table class="hand">
	<tr>
		<td>♠ AQT76<br>♥ J93<br>♦ K75<br>♣ 84</td>
	</tr>
</table>

to

<table class="hand">
	<tr>
		<td>♠ 84<br>♥ J93<br>♦ K75<br>♣ AQT76</td>
	</tr>
</table>

In first or second position, you shouldn't open either hand since the objective is to make a descriptive call that will serve as the basis for a constructive auction. Partner will expect a full opening bid.

In third position, you might open either hand with the hope of getting a small partscore or helping partner on opening lead.

In fourth position, however, you want to get a plus score, or at least not get a minus score, which might happen if you open and get too high or the opponents compete and make a contract. That's a reason for applying the Guideline of 15 - high-card points plus the number of spades - and opening with the first hand (10 + 5 = 15) but passing with the second hand (10 + 2 = 12).

### Tip #2 - Be Prepared for the Rebid

Opener should be prepared for any response and consider the possibility of having to find a rebid.

Consider the hand

<table class="hand">
	<tr>
		<td>♠ AJT75<br>♥ Q4<br>♦ K75<br>♣ J83</td>
	</tr>
</table>

and

<table class="hand">
	<tr>
		<td>♠ AJT75<br>♥ 4<br>♦ K75<br>♣ Q832</td>
	</tr>
</table>

Both are borderline openings in third or fourth position. To avoid getting too high with the first hand after opening 1♠, you are prepared to pass any response. Even if partner responds 2♥ you can pass since partner should have a five-card suit or longer to bid hearts at the two level. With the second hand, however, you'll be awkwardly placed if you open 1♠ and partner responds 2♥. That might sway your judgment to pass rather than open.

### Tip #3 - Be Flexible with the Guidelines

When opening in first of second position, there are guidelines when you have a choice of suits to bid. In third or fourth position, you can occasionally consider bending those guidelines.

Look at the hand

<table class="hand">
	<tr>
		<td>♠ J83<br>♥ J753<br>♦ 94<br>♣ AKQT</td>
	</tr>
</table>

and

<table class="hand">
	<tr>
		<td>♠ J83<br>♥ AKQT<br>♦ 94<br>♣ J753</td>
	</tr>
</table>

Both are borderline hands that are probably worth opening in third or fourth position. With the first hand, you'd make the standard opening bid of 1♣. With the second hand, you might want to consider the advantage of opening 1♥ rather than 1♣, to suggest a lead if you don't win the auction. Even though the partnership style is five-card majors, there's always some room for judgment.

### Tip #4 - Drury

A disadvantage of light opening bids in third and fourth position is that responder is sometimes faced with a dilemma.

Suppose you pass as South with

<table class="hand">
	<tr>
		<td>♠ AJ4<br>♥ K53<br>♦ Q9542<br>♣ 42</td>
	</tr>
</table>

and partner opens the bidding 1♥. What call do you make?

<table class="auction">
	<tr>
		<th>North</th>
		<th>East</th>
		<th>South</th>
		<th>West</th>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td></td>
		<td></td>
		<td>Pass</td>
		<td>Pass</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>1♥</td>
		<td>Pass</td>
		<td>?</td>
		<td></td>
	</tr>
</table>

If partner opened in first or second position, you could respond 2♦ in Standard Methods, intending to later show the heart support. Now you can't afford to start by bidding 2♦ since it is not forcing after your initial pass. If partner passes 2♦, you will have missed the heart fit. An invitational jump raise to 3♥ is not much better. You have only three-card support and you could get the partnership too high if partner has opened light. The partnership may have missed the opportunity to get a small plus score in a partscore contract of 2♥.

To get around this problem, some partnerships adopt the Drury convention.

After an opening bid of 1♥ or 1♠ in third or fourth position, a response of 2♣ is artificial. It shows three-card or longer support for opener's suit with about 9 or more points and asks whether opener has a full opening bid.

Using the popular style of Reverse Drury, opener simply rebids the major suit with a light opening bid. Any other rebid shows interest in reaching game.

With this hand, you would respond with an artificial 2♣ to partner's 1♥ opening. If opener rebids 2♥, you would pass and settle for partscore.

## Questions

### 01

You are South. Neither side is vulnerable.

<table class="hand">
	<tr>
		<td>♠ J9752<br>♥ KJ3<br>♦ Q95<br>♣ Q7</td>
	</tr>
</table>

<table class="auction">
	<tr>
		<th>North</th>
		<th>East</th>
		<th>South</th>
		<th>West</th>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>Pass</td>
		<td>Pass</td>
		<td>?</td>
		<td></td>
	</tr>
</table>

#### Suggested Answer

Pass

No reason to emphasize the weak spade suit.

### 02

You are South. Neither side is vulnerable.

<table class="hand">
	<tr>
		<td>♠ 73<br>♥ K82<br>♦ 95<br>♣ AQJ973</td>
	</tr>
</table>

<table class="auction">

		<th>South</th>
		<th>West</th>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>Pass</td>
		<td>Pass</td>
		<td>?</td>
		<td></td>
	</tr>
</table>

#### Suggested Answer

1♣ (3♣)

Show the clubs. Some players might choose to open with a preemptive 3♣ in third position. 

### 03

You are South. Neither side is vulnerable.

<table class="hand">
	<tr>
		<td>♠ AJ72<br>♥ KJT85<br>♦ 5<br>♣ T53</td>
	</tr>
</table>

<table class="auction">
	<tr>
		<th>North</th>
		<th>East</th>
		<th>South</th>
		<th>West</th>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>Pass</td>
		<td>Pass</td>
		<td>?</td>
		<td></td>
	</tr>
</table>

#### Suggested Answer

Pass (1♥)

You might risk opening this hand, but if partner responds 2♦, you will have an awkward rebid.

### 04

You are South. Neither side is vulnerable.

<table class="hand">
	<tr>
		<td>♠ AKQ7<br>♥ 862<br>♦ KJ<br>♣ 8532</td>
	</tr>
</table>

<table class="auction">
	<tr>
		<th>North</th>
		<th>East</th>
		<th>South</th>
		<th>West</th>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>Pass</td>
		<td>Pass</td>
		<td>?</td>
		<td></td>
	</tr>
</table>

#### Suggested Answer

1♠ (1♣)

With a full opening bid of 13 high-card points, you would open 1♣ in first or second position since you don't have a five-card major suit. In third position, you would definitely open but might consider 1♠ instead of 1♣. If the opponents play the contract, you don't want a club lead from partner.

### 05

You are South. Neither side is vulnerable.

<table class="hand">
	<tr>
		<td>♠ Q72<br>♥ Q85<br>♦ KQJ94<br>♣ 53</td>
	</tr>
</table>

<table class="auction">
	<tr>
		<th>North</th>
		<th>East</th>
		<th>South</th>
		<th>West</th>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>Pass</td>
		<td>Pass</td>
		<td>?</td>
		<td></td>
	</tr>
</table>

#### Suggested Answer

1♦ (Pass)

Is it worth the risk to open 1♦ and get the partnership off to the best lead if your side is defending? A close decision. You are not vulnerable and are prepared to pass any response by partner, so many players would take a chance.

### 06

You are South. Neither side is vulnerable.

<table class="hand">
	<tr>
		<td>♠ 98642<br>♥ KQ74<br>♦ AJ<br>♣ 98</td>
	</tr>
</table>

<table class="auction">
	<tr>
		<th>North</th>
		<th>East</th>
		<th>South</th>
		<th>West</th>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td></td>
		<td></td>
		<td></td>
		<td>Pass</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>Pass</td>
		<td>Pass</td>
		<td>?</td>
		<td></td>
	</tr>
</table>

#### Suggested Answer

1♠

Only 10 high-card points, but it meets the Guideline of 15 (10 + 5 = 15).

### 07

You are South. Neither side is vulnerable.

<table class="hand">
	<tr>
		<td>♠ AKQ9<br>♥ T85<br>♦ K83<br>♣ 754</td>
	</tr>
</table>

<table class="auction">
	<tr>
		<th>North</th>
		<th>East</th>
		<th>South</th>
		<th>West</th>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td></td>
		<td></td>
		<td></td>
		<td>Pass</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>Pass</td>
		<td>Pass</td>
		<td>?</td>
		<td></td>
	</tr>
</table>

#### Suggested Answer

1♠

If you're going to open this hand in fourth position, treat the spades as five-card suit.

### 08

You are South. Neither side is vulnerable.

<table class="hand">
	<tr>
		<td>♠ <br>♥ AK95<br>♦ AQ872<br>♣ Q854</td>
	</tr>
</table>

<table class="auction">
	<tr>
		<th>North</th>
		<th>East</th>
		<th>South</th>
		<th>West</th>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td></td>
		<td></td>
		<td></td>
		<td>Pass</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>Pass</td>
		<td>Pass</td>
		<td>?</td>
		<td></td>
	</tr>
</table>

#### Suggested Answer

1♦

The spade void shouldn't deter you from opening a good hand.

### 09

You are South. Neither side is vulnerable.

<table class="hand">
	<tr>
		<td>♠ 9<br>♥ 3<br>♦ KQ9875<br>♣ AQ873</td>
	</tr>
</table>

<table class="auction">
	<tr>
		<th>North</th>
		<th>East</th>
		<th>South</th>
		<th>West</th>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td></td>
		<td></td>
		<td></td>
		<td>Pass</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>Pass</td>
		<td>Pass</td>
		<td>?</td>
		<td></td>
	</tr>
</table>

#### Suggested Answer

Pass (2♦)

The Guideline of 15 (11 + 1 = 12) suggests passing, even though you'd open in any other position. If you want to open, a preemptive opening of 2♦ with a six-card suit (or perhaps 3♦) might be better than 1♦. It would make it more difficult for the opponents to compete.

### 10

You are South. Neither side is vulnerable.

<table class="hand">
	<tr>
		<td>♠ J8752<br>♥ K<br>♦ K7642<br>♣ QJ</td>
	</tr>
</table>

<table class="auction">
	<tr>
		<th>North</th>
		<th>East</th>
		<th>South</th>
		<th>West</th>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td></td>
		<td></td>
		<td></td>
		<td>Pass</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>Pass</td>
		<td>Pass</td>
		<td>?</td>
		<td></td>
	</tr>
</table>

#### Suggested Answer

Pass (1♠)

The hand does meet the Guideline of 15 (10 + 5 = 15), but that doesn't prevent you from exercising some judgment. All those queens and jacks and potentially wasted honors in short suits should persuade you to move on to the next deal.
