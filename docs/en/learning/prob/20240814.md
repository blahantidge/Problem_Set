Today's quiz is based on Audrey Grant Improving Your Judgment 1: Opening the Bidding - Obstructive Opening bids: Part 1.

<Badge type="danger" text="Bid"/>

## Introduction

### Obstructive Opening bids: Part 1

Obstructive opening bids are designed to get in the way of the opponents. They are popular in today's auctions. In addition to bidding constructively to your side's best contract, it's equally important to prevent the opponents from reaching their optimum spot.

Opening at a high-level with a long suit and less than the values for a one-level bid is risky. Yet, it's often a good idea. You could:

- Push the opponents too high
- Make your contract
- Be defeated but lose less than if the opponents were allowed to play in their best contract.

On the other hand, the opponents could double you and get a good score. Preemptive opening bids require a delicate balance between aggressiveness and safety.

The value of a hand with a long suit is usually estimated using playing tricks instead of high-card strength and length points. Playing tricks are those you might reasonably expect to take if you buy the contract and name the trump suit.

Compare the hand

<table class="hand">
	<tr>
		<td>♠ KQJT987<br>♥ 4<br>♦ T3<br>♣ 876</td>
	</tr>
</table>

with

<table class="hand">
	<tr>
		<td>♠ AK7<br>♥ AK9<br>♦ AK8<br>♣ 8764</td>
	</tr>
</table>

The second hand above has 21 high-card points; the first one has 6. Yet both hands are worth six playing tricks.

Unlike the second hand, with the first hand you don't expect to take many tricks if the opponents play in another suit. This is the ideal hand for a preemptive opening bid, describing the hand and obstructing the opponents.

A preemptive opening at the three level, 3♣, 3♦, 3♥, or 3♠ shows:

- A long, strong suit, typically seven cards in length
- A weak hand, less than the values for a one-level opening bid.

With a longer suit, you can open at a higher level:

- With a weak hand and a good eight-card suit, open at the four level
- With a weak hand and a good nine-card suit, open at game level. With a minor, that means opening at the five level. With a nine-card major, open at the four level. You don't want to pass the game level in case, with a little help from partner, you can take exactly 10 tricks.

An opening bid of 2♦, 2♥, or 2♠ (2♣ is reserved for strong hands) shows:

- A good six-card suit
- A weak hand, typically 5-11 high-card points

In making a preemptive opening, you deliberately overbid. You don't expect to make your contract unless partner can provide some tricks. If not, there's the possibility the opponents could make something. So they may double the contract for penalties to try to compensate for their lost opportunity. To estimate how much you can afford to overbid, the guideline is to assume the opponents can make a game contract.

Although the value of an opponent's game depends on the vulnerability, the idea is that a game is worth approximately 500 points. So, you can overbid by two tricks when vulnerable since the penalty, if doubled, would be 500 - 200 for the first trick and 300 for the second. You can overbid by three tricks when non-vulnerable since the penalty would still be 500 if doubled - 100 for the first trick, 200 for the second, and 200 for the third. This is called the Guideline of Two and Three or the Guideline of 500.

This hand is on the low end of the scale but most players would risk a weak two bid when non-vulnerable.

<table class="hand">
	<tr>
		<td>♠ 84<br>♥ 7<br>♦ QJT975<br>♣ QT62</td>
	</tr>
</table>

The diamonds should provide four playing tricks and you will likely get one from the club suit. Overbidding by three tricks is in line with the Guideline of 500.

Other guidelines with be discussed in Part 2.

## Questions

### 01

You are South. Neither side is vulnerable.

<table class="hand">
	<tr>
		<td>♠ KQT843<br>♥ 7<br>♦ QJ5<br>♣ 942</td>
	</tr>

	</tr>
	<tr>

		<td></td>
	</tr>
</table>

#### Suggested Answer

**2♠**

An opening weak two-bid will describe the hand nicely: a good six-card suit and 5-11 points.

### 02

You are South. Neither side is vulnerable.

<table class="hand">
	<tr>
		<td>♠ 63<br>♥ AKJT7532<br>♦ 8<br>♣ T8</td>

	<tr>

		<td></td>
		<td>?</td>

	</tr>
</table>

#### Suggested Answer

**4♥**

With a good eight-card suit and no outside strength, open at the four level. This would be a good choice even if vulnerable.

### 03

You are South. Neither side is vulnerable.

<table class="hand">
	<tr>
		<td>♠ KJ4<br>♥ 3<br>♦ AQJ9752<br>♣ J5</td>
	</tr>
</table>

	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td></td>
		<td></td>
		<td>?</td>
		<td></td>
	</tr>
</table>

#### Suggested Answer

**1♦**

You have a good seven-card suit and enough strength to open at the
one level. No need to take away your side's bidding room.

### 04

You are South. Neither side is vulnerable.

<table class="hand">
	<tr>
		<td>♠ <br>♥ 6<br>♦ 763<br>♣ AKT987532</td>
	</tr>

	</tr>
</table>

#### Suggested Answer

**5♣**

With a nine-card suit, open at the game level.

### 05

You are South. Neither side is vulnerable.

<table class="hand">
	<tr>
		<td>♠ J865432<br>♥ KQ5<br>♦ 7<br>♣ Q3</td>
	</tr>
</table>

<table class="auction">

		<th>North</th>
		<th>East</th>
		<th>South</th>
		<th>West</th>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td></td>
		<td></td>
		<td>?</td>
		<td></td>
	</tr>
</table>

#### Suggested Answer

**Pass**

With a poor suit and high cards outside of spades, this would not be a sound preemptive opening. 

### 06

You are South. Neither side is vulnerable.

<table class="hand">
	<tr>
		<td>♠ 94<br>♥ 3<br>♦ T43<br>♣ KQJ9642</td>
	</tr>
</table>

<table class="auction">
	<tr>
		<th>North</th>
		<th>East</th>
		<th>South</th>
		<th>West</th>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td></td>
		<td></td>
		<td>?</td>
		<td></td>
	</tr>
</table>

#### Suggested Answer

**3♣**

A good seven-card suit and only six high-card points, ideal for a non-vulnerable three-level preemptive opening. You can afford to overbid by three tricks, following the Guideline of 500.

### 07

You are South. Both sides are vulnerable.

<table class="hand">
	<tr>
		<td>♠ 5<br>♥ AKJT75<br>♦ JT62<br>♣ 73</td>
	</tr>
</table>

<table class="auction">
	<tr>
		<th>North</th>
		<th>East</th>
		<th>South</th>
		<th>West</th>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td></td>
		<td>Pass</td>
		<td>?</td>
		<td></td>
	</tr>
</table>

#### Suggested Answer

**2♥**

Although you are vulnerable, a weak two-bid should be relatively safe with this hand. You have at least five playing tricks in the heart suit and might take six if the ♥Q is favorably located. If not, you might get a sixth trick from the diamond suit.

### 08

You are South. Both sides are vulnerable.

<table class="hand">
	<tr>
		<td>♠ 84<br>♥ 5<br>♦ AKQ8753<br>♣ T95</td>
	</tr>
</table>

<table class="auction">
	<tr>
		<th>North</th>
		<th>East</th>
		<th>South</th>
		<th>West</th>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td></td>
		<td>Pass</td>
		<td>?</td>
		<td></td>
	</tr>
</table>

#### Suggested Answer

**3♦**

The hand meets the requirements for a three-level preemptive opening bid. There are about seven playing tricks in diamonds unless the suit breaks badly, so vulnerability should not deter you.

### 09

You are South. Both sides are vulnerable.

<table class="hand">
	<tr>
		<td>♠ KJ97432<br>♥ 86<br>♦ 74<br>♣ 42</td>
	</tr>
</table>

<table class="auction">
	<tr>
		<th>North</th>
		<th>East</th>
		<th>South</th>
		<th>West</th>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td></td>
		<td>Pass</td>
		<td>?</td>
		<td></td>
	</tr>
</table>

#### Suggested Answer

**Pass**

You have a weak hand with a seven-card suit but it would be dangerous to open 3♠ when vulnerable. This suit is unlikely to provide six playing tricks.

### 10

You are South. The opponents are vulnerable and your side is not.

<table class="hand">
	<tr>
		<td>♠ 2<br>♥ 75<br>♦ QT97653<br>♣ T42</td>
	</tr>
</table>

<table class="auction">
	<tr>
		<th>North</th>
		<th>East</th>
		<th>South</th>
		<th>West</th>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>Pass</td>
		<td>Pass</td>
		<td>?</td>
		<td></td>
	</tr>
</table>

#### Suggested Answer

**3◆ (Pass)**

The suit isn't that great and you might suffer a large penalty. On the other hand, partner has passed, so the opponents very likely have a game or slam. Some players would take the risk of preempting.
