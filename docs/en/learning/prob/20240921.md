On this deal, are you paying attention to the opponents' distribution?

<Badge type="warning" text="Play"/>

## The Auction

<table class="hand">
	<tr>
		<td>♠ AK<br>♥ KQJ<br>♦ K5<br>♣ AKJ864</td>
	</tr>
</table>

Suppose you are dealer sitting South. Both sides are vulnerable. You have to choose an opening call in first position.

The hand is semi-balanced and has 24 high-card points plus 2 length points for the six-card club suit. That's enough for game without any help from partner. Some players might open 3NT with this hand, but the popular modern style is to use a 3NT opening as a Gambling 3NT. Using standard methods, you would open a strong artificial 2♣ bid.

West passes. Partner, North, responds with an artificial 2♦ bid. East passes, and you have to decide on a rebid.

Although you might make a forcing rebid showing the six-card club suit, the hand is semi-balanced with stoppers in all the suits. The hand seems more suited to a notrump rebid. With 26 points, you would rebid 3NT. 2NT would show only 22-24 points and would not be forcing. So let's go with 3NT.

West passes, and partner raises all the way to 6NT. East passes. The auction is back to you.

Having described the hand with the 2♣ opening and 3NT rebid, you have nothing further to say after partner chooses to play in 6NT. You pass.

West passes. You are now the declarer in 6NT with West on lead.

## Planning the Play

West leads the ♥10, and partner puts down the dummy.

<table class="deal">

		<td>♠ J72<br>♥ 762<br>♦ AQJT3<br>♣ 97</td>
		<td></td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>♠ <br>♥ <br>♦ <br>♣ </td>

	</tr>
</table>

With 8 high-card points plus 1 length point for the five-card diamond suit, partner has the values for raising to slam over the 3NT bid.

The first step in the slam contract is to count the winners. There are two spade winners, the ♠A and ♠K. You don't start with any sure tricks in hearts, but West has led the ♥10. Assuming East plays the ♥A at trick one, you will have two heart winners. Even if the ♥A isn't played on the first trick, you can still promote a second heart winner. There are two sure club tricks, the ♣A and ♣K. There are five sure diamond winners, the ♦A, ♦K, ♦Q, ♦J, and ♦10. That gives you a starting total of eleven tricks: two spades, two hearts, two clubs, and five diamonds. You need to find only one more trick.

You aren't getting any more tricks from hearts or diamonds and are unlikely to get an extra trick from spades unless the ♠Q falls singleton or doubleton.

It looks like the twelfth trick will have to come from the club suit. With eight dubs in the combined hands, the guideline eight ever, nine never tells you that taking a finesse for the ♣Q has better odds than playing the ♣A and ♣K, hoping the ♣Q will fall doubleton. You can afford to play one high club first in case West started with a singleton ♣Q. Even if the finesse doesn't work, your remaining clubs will be winners as long as West didn't start with four clubs including the ♣Q and ♣10.

Is there a problem?

Certainly! You will have already lost a heart trick, so you can't afford to lose a club trick. It appears you are dependent on the club finesse working.

Let's see how the play might start off.

## Possible Play

West has led the ♥10. You play low from dummy, and East wins the first trick with the ♥A. So you have two heart tricks without needing to do any more work. East returns a heart at trick two.

Since you only need one extra trick from clubs, there's no harm in playing a high club before taking the finesse, just in case the ♣Q falls, solving all your problems. However, only low clubs appear from both opponents.

To try the club finesse, you need to get to dummy. The only entry is in the diamond suit. Although you could overtake the ♦K with the ♦A to get two entries to dummy, you need only one entry and it might cost you a diamond trick if the suit breaks badly. So you start with the high card from the short side by playing the ♦K. Both defenders follow suit. Suppose you continue with your remaining diamond to dummy's ♦10. On this trick, West shows out. It's a good thing you didn't overtake the ♦K. With the 5-1 division of the suit, it would have cost you a diamond trick.

Now that you are in dummy, you can't take the club finesse right away. That would leave the remaining diamonds stranded. So you have to take the diamond winners now. On the third round of diamonds, you discard a low club and West discards another spade. You take another diamond winner, discarding another club as West discards yet another spade. You take the last diamond winner, discarding your remaining low club. West discards one more spade.

You can't put off the club finesse any longer. You lead a club from dummy and, when East follows with the ♣10, you try the ♣J. Sadly, this loses to the ♣Q.

You have the rest of the tricks, but 6NT is down one.

Too bad. Should you have played the ♣K instead of the ♣J? Did West start with a doubleton ♣Q?

Let's see the remaining cards.

No. West still has a club remaining. So West didn't start with a doubleton ♣Q.

How could the contract be made?

When this actual deal was played, four-time Grammy Award winner, Bobbie Gentry, was the declarer. Let's see how she played the contract.

## Recommended Play

Against Bobbie Gentry, the play started the same way. West led the ♥10, and East won the first trick with the ♥A. East continued with another heart, and Gentry won the second trick.

Although the contract seemed to hinge on the club finesse, she first gave herself the extra chance that the ♠Q would fall singleton or doubleton. She played the ♠A, but only low spades appeared. She continued with the ♠K. Again, the ♠Q didn't appear, but on this trick, East discarded a low heart. West had started with seven spades and East with only one.

Gentry next played the ♣A, giving herself the chance that the ♣Q would fall. Only low clubs appeared from both defenders.

She then made a key play. Before playing the diamond winners, she took her last heart winner. On this trick, West showed out. Interesting. West had started with only two hearts and East had started with five.

It was time to take the diamond winners. Both defenders followed with low diamonds when she played the ♦K. However, West showed out on the second round of diamonds, discarding a spade. That was interesting. East started with five diamonds and West with only one. She played another diamond. She discarded a low club as West discarded a spade. On the next diamond winner, she discarded another low club and West discarded another spade. On the last diamond winner, Gentry discarded her last low club and West also discarded a low club. Since neither the ♠Q nor the ♣Q had appeared, it was down to leading dummy's remaining club. East followed with the ♣10. Gentry was at the critical point in the play. Should she play the ♣K or finesse the ♣J?

Gentry thought about what she knew at this point. West had shown out on the third round of hearts, so East had started with five hearts. West had shown out on the second round of diamonds, so East had started with five diamonds. East had followed to one round of spades, and on this play, East followed to the second round of clubs. All of East's cards were known. East had started with one spade, five hearts, and five diamonds. That left room for only two clubs. The ♣10 must be East's last club.

So West must hold the ♣Q!

She played the ♣K and West's ♣Q came tumbling down!

The ♣J was her twelfth trick. She had made the slam with two spade tricks, two hearts, five diamonds, and **three** club tricks.

But didn't West start with three clubs? Why did West discard one?

Let's look at the position when the last diamond was led from dummy.

## A Closer Look...

This was the position when Gentry led the last diamond winner from dummy.

<table class="deal">
	<tr>
		<td></td>
		<td>♠ J<br>♥ <br>♦ J<br>♣ 9</td>
		<td></td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>♠ Q<br>♥ <br>♦ <br>♣ Q5</td>
		<td><pre>   N<br>W     E<br>   S</pre></td>

	</tr>
	<tr>

		<td>♠ <br>♥ <br>♦ <br>♣ KJ8</td>
		<td></td>
	</tr>
</table>

West still held the ♠Q and the doubleton ♣Q. East followed suit and Gentry discarded her last low club, but what was West to discard?

If West discarded the ♠Q, dummy's ♠J would become a winner and Gentry could discard the ♣J on it. That left West with no choice but to discard the low club, hoping that declarer wouldn't guess what to do.

Dummy's ♣9 was led. And when Gentry played the ♣K - having figured out that East had no more clubs after the ♣10 - West's ♣Q fell. The ♣J took the last trick. West could do nothing about it.

The technique that Bobbie Gentry used to make the contract is referred to as a squeeze. At trick eleven, West held the ♠Q and the ♣Q-5 and wanted to hold on to all three cards. Unfortunately, West had to discard one of them. West was squeezed out of one of the potential winners. Whichever card West chose would allow declarer to make the contract.

When this deal was reported in the Aces' syndicated newspaper column, it was stated that on being complimented on the fine play, Gentry said, "Well, actually all I did was note who showed out of what suits to count East's distribution!" As the column concluded, "Was Miss Gentry talented? Yes, indeed!"

Of course, Bobbie Gentry was a talent in the world of country music. In 1986, she won three Grammy Awards for Best New Artist, Best Female Pop Vocal Performance, and Best Contemporary Rock and Roll Performance. She would later be given the Fall of Fame Award.

Bobbie Gentry is probably best known for her "Ode to Billie Joe" in which she sings about "Billie Joe throwing somethin' off the Tallahatchie Bridge." In the picture above, she can be seen walking on the Tallahatchie Bridge.
