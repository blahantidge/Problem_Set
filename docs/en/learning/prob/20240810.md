On this deal, you'll need a lot of luck and good play to make your contract.

## The Auction

<table class="hand">
	<tr>
		<td>♠ AKT76<br>♥ 5<br>♦ AJ<br>♣ AKQ95</td>
	</tr>
</table>

Suppose you are sitting South. The opponents are vulnerable and your side is not. Partner, North, is the dealer and passes. East also passes. You have to decide what call to make with this hand in third position.

You have 21 high-card points plus 1 length point for each five-card suit, bringing the total to 23. Although some players might open only 1♠ - or perhaps 1♣ in some partnerships - the hand is strong enough to start with a strong artificial 2♣ opening. You don't need much from partner to make game. So let's go with 2♣.

West interferes by overcalling 2♦. Partner now bids 2♥. This shows a decent five-card or longer heart suit and at least game-going values, about 6 or more points, typically with at least an ace or two kings. East passes, and the auction is back to you.

With no fit for partner's hearts, you can show your suits, starting with the higher ranking, spades.

West passes, and partner raises to 3♠, showing three-card or longer support. East passes, and the auction is back to you.

Since you have a spade fit and partner has shown some values, slam is a possibility. You might make a control-showing bid of 4♣ to see what partner has to say. A more straightforward approach is to simply ask about aces. Let's go with that.

West passes, and partner replies 5♦, showing one ace playing standard methods. (Or partner makes the equivalent response to show one keycard if the partnership plays key-card Blackwood.) East passes. Your side has all the aces. What now?

A grand slam is still possible if partner has one of the missing kings. In standard methods, you can ask about kings by continuing the Blackwood convention and bidding 5NT. Let's go with that. (If the partnership plays key-card Blackwood, South can inquire about the trump queen first. That's not possible with standard Blackwood.)

West passes, and partner replies 6♣, showing no kings. (If playing key-card Blackwood, partner shows the ♠Q but no kings.) Now what?

Missing both red kings makes a grand slam unlikely. You settle for a small slam in spades.

Everyone passes, and you are now the declarer in 6♠ with West on lead.

## Planning the Play

West leads the ♥K, and partner puts down the dummy.

<table class="deal">
	<tr>
		<td></td>
		<td>♠ Q53<br>♥ A9762<br>♦ 764<br>♣ T3</td>
		<td></td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>♠ <br>♥ <br>♦ <br>♣ </td>
		<td><pre>   N<br>W     E<br>   S</pre></td>
		<td>♠ <br>♥ <br>♦ <br>♣ </td>
	</tr>
	<tr>

		<td></td>
	</tr>
</table>

Partner has only 6 points, but both the ♠Q and ♥A are very valuable.

You now need to consider your potential losers in 6♠. You won't have any spade losers if the five missing spades are divided 3-2. If the spades are 4-1, you will be okay if the ♠J falls singleton or if East has the four spades and you can find out in time to take a finesse against the ♠J. If the spades are 5-0... best not to think about it. You don't have any heart losers since dummy's ♥A will take care of the singleton heart in your hand. You have a potential club loser since you are missing the ♣J. Finally, you will be left with a diamond loser after the ♦A is gone. So assuming that the spades behave, it looks as though you have only two losers to worry about, a club and a diamond. You'll have to eliminate one of them.

There doesn't appear to be any way to avoid the diamond loser.

In clubs, you will be fine if the six missing clubs are divided 3-3 or the ♣J falls singleton or doubleton. Is that your only chance?

You won't be able to establish a heart winner in dummy on which to discard a diamond or a club loser. You don't have enough entries to establish and reach a heart winner even if the seven missing hearts are divided 4-3. However, you do have additional chances in clubs. If you think East has four clubs, including the ♣J, you could take a finesse. Another possibility is to ruff a club in dummy if the suit is divided 4-2. That would be easy if there were four spades in dummy. You could draw the defenders' trumps and, if they divide 3-2, you would still have a trump left in dummy. With only three trumps in dummy, however, it's not so easy.

Let's see how the play might go if you rely on the clubs dividing 3-3 or the ♣J falling.

## Possible Play

West has led the ♥K and you win the first trick with dummy's ♥A.

If you are going to draw the defenders' trumps, you should start with a high spade from your hand. Both defenders follow suit, so at least the spades haven't divided 5-0. You then continue with a spade to dummy's ♠Q. If West were to show out on this trick, you would be in a position to take a finesse against East's ♠J. Both defenders follow suit, however. So that's not a problem. The missing spades have divided 3-2. You are at the critical point in the play. Let's see what will happen if you draw the defenders' last trump.

You play a spade to your hand, and capture East's ♠J with the ♠A. That takes care of the defenders' trumps. Now it is safe to play clubs. You take a trick with the ♣A. Both defenders follow suit, but the ♣J doesn't appear. You continue with the ♣K. Again, both defenders follow, but the ♣J still doesn't fall. You continue with the Q, hoping both the remaining clubs will fall. West shows out, however. East still has the ♣J. You are going to have to lose a club trick to East's ♣J. And you are eventually going to have to lose a diamond trick. 6♠ is down one.

Let's go back and try again. 

## Recommended Play

West has led the ♥K. Dummy's ♥A wins the first trick. You draw one round of trumps with the ♠K. Both defenders follow suit. You draw a second round of trumps to dummy's ♠Q. Again, both defenders follow suit. The missing spades have divided 3-2.

There is still one trump outstanding, but you have seen the problem if you draw it at this point. You will have to rely on the clubs dividing 3-3 or the ♣J falling. However, you can give yourself a better chance.

You can start playing clubs.

You might as well lead the ♣10. Perhaps East will cover with the ♣J and save you any problems. East plays low, however, so you win the trick with the ♣Q. (You could actually make the contract at this point by taking a club finesse, but that isn't necessary.) You continue with the ♣A. Both defenders follow, but no ♣J appears. If the ♣J had appeared, you would draw the last trump and claim the contract.

Now you continue with the ♣K!

If both defenders follow suit, the clubs have divided 3-3 and you can draw the last trump. All you lose is a diamond trick at the end.

What if a defender ruffs the ♣K?

Then the clubs have divided 4-2 and you were never going to make the contract anyway. It doesn't actually cost anything since that's the defenders' last trump and you can now ruff a club with dummy's remaining trump to establish your fifth club. You'll be down one trick, the same as if you had drawn all the trumps and then had to give up a club trick.

The advantage of playing the clubs before drawing the last trump is revealed on the actual deal. West does show out on the third round of clubs, so the clubs have divided 4-2. West, however, doesn't ruff the club! Because you have drawn two rounds of trumps, West doesn't have another trump. The bad luck of the clubs breaking 4-2 is countered by the fact that West, the player with only a doubleton club, also started with only two spades. Since East still has the ♣J, you can now lead another club and ruff it in dummy. Again, West can't do anything since West doesn't have a trump. East has to follow suit with the ♣J, and now your fifth club has been established as a winner.

You come back to your hand with the ♦A... or by ruffing a heart. Finally, you draw the outstanding trump, which you now know East holds. Your last club is a winner, and you have made your 6♠ slam contract. You still have to lose a diamond, but that's all.

## The Actual Play

So this deal is somewhat interesting and it requires some good technique to make 6♠. But why does it fall into the famous category?

It is famous because, when the deal was actually played, the final
contract was 7♠, not 6♠!

Sitting South was Marv Rosenblatt, playing with Art Waldmann in the 1983 Spingold. There were playing against Paul Soloway and Bobby Goldman, world champions and members of the famous Dallas Aces team.

In the actual auction, Rosenblatt opened 1♣. West overcalled 1♦. Waldmann, North, responded 1♥. East passed, and Rosenblatt then showed the strength of the hand with a jump shift to 2♠. Waldmann raised to 3♠ with only three-card support. Rosenblatt was expecting four-card support. After finding out that North held an ace, Rosenblatt invited a grand slam with a cuebid of 6♦. Waldmann thought the ♠Q was what partner was looking for and accepted the invitation by bidding 7♠.

Although the auction left a lot to be desired, it was then up to Rosenblatt to find a way to take all thirteen tricks! Even knowing how all the cards laid, this was not an easy thing to do. Let's see how Rosenblatt managed to accomplish this feat.

Rosenblatt got the same lead of the ♥K and won the first trick with dummy's ♥A. He realized that the only way to make the grand slam was to ruff his diamond loser in dummy. And the only way he could accomplish that was to discard two of dummy's diamonds on clubs. However, that meant playing four rounds of clubs while still leaving a trump outstanding in a defender's hand since he would need it to ruff the diamond loser.

So he made his first key play. He led the ♣10 from dummy - just in case East might cover it and solve that problem.

East, however, played low and Rosenblatt won the trick with the ♣A. Next, he drew a round of trumps with the ♠A. He drew a second round of trumps by playing a spade to dummy's ♠Q. He couldn't afford to draw a third round of trumps since he needed dummy's last trump to ruff his diamond loser. Instead, he led the last club from dummy. East followed with another low club, and Rosenblatt made his second critical play.

He finessed the ♣9!

He knew he couldn't make the grand slam if the defenders' clubs were divided 3-3. He needed them to be divided 4-2 so that he could discard two diamonds from dummy and not have a club winner ruffed.

The club finesse worked, and he was part way to making the contract. He just needed a little more luck... a lot more actually. He played one of his high clubs. Good news! West showed out, so the defenders' clubs had indeed divided 4-2 and East was going to have to follow suit to both this club and the next one. Better news! West didn't ruff the club. So West didn't have the defenders' last trump. On the club winner, he discarded one of dummy's diamonds. East had to follow suit with a club. He played his other high club. Again, West couldn't do anything, another diamond was discarded from dummy, and East had to follow suit with his last club, the ♣J.

There was only one hurdle remaining. He still needed East to have two diamonds, even though West had overcalled the suit. Rosenblatt took a trick with the ♦A. He led his diamond loser and ruffed it in dummy. When East followed suit to this trick, the contract was assured. He ruffed a heart to get back to his hand. He finally drew the outstanding trump in East's hand. The last club in his hand was a winner. And his last spade was the thirteenth trick.

Rosenblatt had made the grand slam!

Rosenblatt's fine play won his team a major swing since the opponents stopped - reasonably enough - in a small slam. It wasn't enough, however, to win the match. Soloway and Goldman, along with their teammates, went on to win the match and the 1983 Spingold.

But Rosenblatt did not go unrewarded. For his outstanding play on this deal, Marv Rosenblatt received the 1983 Bols Brilliancy Prize, awarded by the Dutch liqueur manufacturer. For a number of years, the Bols company was the chief sponsor of bridge. Bridge journalists from around the world would submit columns covering well-played deals, and the International Bridge Press Association would select the best played deal of the year, along with the best defended and the best bid. After Bols discontinued the sponsorship, the awards have continued each year by the International Bridge Press Association with various sponsors.
