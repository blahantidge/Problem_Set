On this deal, this is an important deal in the match. Can you make your contract?

<Badge type="warning" text="Play"/>

## The Auction

<table class="hand">
	<tr>
		<td>♠ KT9763<br>♥ Q42<br>♦ 5<br>♣ KJ8</td>
	</tr>
</table>

Suppose you are sitting South. Your side is vulnerable and the opponents are not. Partner, North, is the dealer and opens 1♦. East passes, and you have to decide what to respond.

With 9 high-card points plus 2 length points for the six-card spade suit, you have more than enough to respond at the one level. You start by bidding the six-card major suit.

West passes, and partner makes a jump rebid of 3♦. East passes, and the auction is back to you. 

The jump rebid to 3♦ shows a medium-strength opening bid of about 17-18 points and a good six-card or longer diamond suit. You have no fit for diamonds but there is enough combined strength for game. Since the 1♠ response only promises four spades, you can rebid 3♠ to show a good five-card suit or a six-card or longer suit.

West now belatedly enters the auction with a 4♣ overcall. Partner bids 4♠, and East passes. It's your turn to make a call.

With the club honors now of dubious value after West's 4♣ overcall, you certainly aren't interested in bidding any higher. You pass.

West also passes, ending the auction. You are now the declarer in 4♠ with West on lead.

## Planning the Play

West leads the ♥6, and partner puts down the dummy.

You start by considering the potential losers in 4♠. You have a sure spade loser since you can't get around the missing ♠A. However, you are also missing the ♠J for a potential second spade loser. There are also two potential heart losers since you are missing both the ♥A and ♥J. There are three potential club losers in your hand since you are missing the ♣A, ♣Q, and ♣10. The good news is there are no diamond losers. In fact, you have at least two extra winners on which you may be able to discard some losers. So you start with seven potential losers. That's a lot, and three of them are aces! You can afford only three losers.

In spades, you should be able to avoid a second loser if the defenders' spades are divided 2-2 or there is a singleton ♠J. You will also be okay if a defender has a singleton ♠A and you guess whether to lead toward dummy's ♠Q or your ♠K first. Then there is the possibility of taking a finesse against the missing ♠J if you can guess which defender holds it.

West has led a heart, so East presumably holds the ♥A. If you play low from dummy and East takes the ♥A, you won't have any more heart losers. If East doesn't take the ♥A, you can possibly discard both your remaining hearts on dummy's diamond winners to avoid losing any heart tricks. Alternatively, if East doesn't win the ♥A, you could later plan to finesse dummy's ♥10, hoping West holds the ♥J.

In clubs, you could plan to lead a club from dummy and guess whether to play the ♣K or ♣J if East follows with a low club. With West's 4♣ overcall, however, it is unlikely that either the ♣A or ♣Q are favorably located with East. You might hope to ruff at least one club in dummy, perhaps two. Or you could plan to discard one or more clubs on dummy's extra diamond winners.

Lots of possibilities, some depending on what East chooses to do at trick one. Let's see how the play might start off.

## Possible Play

West has led the ♥6. You have your first decision. What are you playing to this trick?

You might as well try the ♥10. If West has the ♥J, East will have to play the ♥A to win the trick, and you will have only one heart loser.

East plays the ♥J, and you win the ♥Q. Well, the heart finesse didn't work, but at least you haven't lost a heart trick yet.

You have another decision. What are you playing next?

If you lead a spade, the opponents can win and, with the ♥A unfavorably placed in the East hand, they can take two heart tricks if West gains the lead and plays another heart. So it looks best to try to discard your remaining heart losers on dummy's diamond winners, hoping the defenders' six diamonds are divided 3-3.

So let's suppose you lead a diamond to dummy's ♦Q. Both defenders follow suit. So far, so good. You continue with another high diamond, discarding one of the heart losers. Again, both defenders follow suit. Things are still going okay. You play dummy's last high diamond, discarding your last heart. East follows suit, but West ruffs with the ♠2. The defenders' diamonds have divided 4-2. You've lost a spade trick you weren't planning on losing, but at least you've avoided losing any heart tricks.

West leads another heart. You play low from dummy, East plays the ♥9, and you ruff with a low spade. You're not down yet. What are you doing next?

You've used up dummy's high diamonds and still have three club losers. It looks like you are going to have to try to ruff two of them in dummy. You'd like to lead a club from dummy, just in case East has one of the high honors. However, there aren't any quick entries to dummy. Besides, it's likely West holds both the ♣A and ♣Q anyway.

So let's suppose you lead a club from your hand. West wins the trick. West continues with another heart. East plays the ♥A on dummy's ♥K, and you again ruff with a low spade.

You can now lead one of your club losers and ruff in dummy. East follows with a club. So far, so good. You need to get back to your hand so you can ruff the last club loser. The best way appears to be by ruffing a diamond. You could try leading a spade, but that would give the opponents an opportunity to play the ♠A and another spade, removing both dummy's trumps.

Suppose you lead a diamond from dummy, and East follows with the defenders' last diamond. You have a critical decision to make. You know West is out of diamonds. Should you ruff with the ♠K or a lower-ranking spade?

It seems best to ruff with a low spade, hoping West doesn't hold the ♠J. If West has the ♠A and overruffs, that should be okay.

Let's suppose you choose to ruff with the ♠7. West discards a club. West doesn't hold the ♠J. That's good. You lead your last club. West covers with the ♣A. You are faced with yet another decision. Should you ruff with dummy's ♠8 or ♠Q?

If East still has a club, it will be safe to ruff with the ♠8. However, given West's 4♣ overcall during the auction, it's unlikely East has any clubs remaining. West presumably has a seven-card suit. You know East has the ♠J, so it seems best to ruff with the ♠Q. Let's see what happens.

Suppose you ruff with the ♠Q. East overruffs with the ♠A. Well, that may still be okay. Since East is out of clubs, if you had ruffed with the ♠8, East would have overruffed with the ♠J.

East leads a heart, and you ruff with the ♠9. West discards a club. There are only two spades outstanding, so you will make the contract if they both fall under your ♠K. When you lead the ♠K, however, West shows out.

You have to lose the last trick to East's ♠J. 4♠ is down one. You lost only one club trick, but you lost three spade tricks.

Could you have done something differently?

When this actual deal was played in the 1981 Venice Cup match between Great Britain and Brazil, sitting South was Sally Brock. Great Britain had a slight lead against Brazil when this deal happened in the last match of the round robin. Brock was partnered by Sandra Landy. Sitting West for Brazil was Agota Mandelot, partnered with Suzy Powidzer. Let's see how Brock played the contract.

## The Actual Play

When Sally Brock played the contract, the play went almost exactly as you have just seen. West led a heart. Brock chose to play a low heart from dummy and East played the ♥9. Brock won the first trick with the ♥Q. She started taking dummy's diamond winners, hoping to get rid of the two remaining heart losers. Both defenders followed to the first round of diamonds. Both defenders also followed to the second round of diamonds as she discarded one of the heart losers. On dummy's last high diamond, she discarded her last heart. West ruffed this trick with the ♠2.

West led another heart. Dummy's ♥10 is played, East played the ♥J, and she ruffed with the ♠3.

Brock then had to do something about the club losers. She chose to lead the ♣K. She didn't want East to win the trick and perhaps lead another diamond, making her guess whether to ruff high or low at that point.

West won the ♣A. West continued with a third round of hearts.
When dummy's ♥K was topped by East's ♥A, she ruffed with the ♠6.

She led one of her club losers and ruffed with dummy's ♠4. She was fairly certain East would follow to this trick since West would have bid earlier in the auction with an eight-card club suit.

She led a diamond from dummy and, when East played the ♦10, she made a key play. She had already decided from the auction and the play so far what the distribution was likely to be. West presumably started with a seven-card club suit and had shown up with three hearts and two diamonds. So West had started with only one spade, the singleton ♠2. That meant East held all three of the outstanding spades, the ♠A-J-5.

Looking ahead, she made a simple but critical play.

Instead of ruffing with the ♠7, she ruffed with the ♠9!

As she anticipated, West discarded a club. West didn't hold the ♠J. She led her last club and, "knowing" that East held no more clubs and all three remaining spades, she ruffed with dummy's ♠Q. This left East with no winning defense.

Let's look at the remaining cards.

	</tr>
	<tr>

		<td>♠ KT7<br>♥ <br>♦ <br>♣ J</td>
		<td></td>
	</tr>
</table>

If East discarded the ♥3, Brock could then lead the ♠8 from dummy. If East then played the ♠5, Brock could play the ♠7, leaving the lead in dummy and trapping East's ♠J when a diamond was led. If East discarded the ♥3 and played the ♠A when dummy's ♠8 was led, East would then have to lead a spade and Brock could finesse the ♠10.

On the actual deal, East chose to overruff with the ♠A. Next, East led the last heart.

Thanks to the careful unblocking of the ♠9 earlier, Brock was able to play the ♠7 on this trick and overruff with dummy's ♠8! She could then lead a diamond from dummy, and East's ♠J was trapped. East had no choice but to ruff with the ♠5, and Brock could overruff with the ♠10. Her ♠K took the last trick as East had to follow helplessly with the ♠J.

Brock had made the 4♠ contract, losing only a club and two spade tricks... the ♠A and ♠2.

The play that Brock executed was a trump coup. Basically, she was able to take a "finesse" against East's ♠J despite having no spades left to lead from dummy. To accomplish this, she needed the foresight to see the importance of ruffing with the ♠9 so that she could later underruff with the ♠7 and reach dummy with the ♠8.

By winning this match, Great Britain narrowly beat Brazil for second place in the five-team round-robin. They got to play the United States in the final and went on to hand the United States its first ever loss in the Venice Cup.
