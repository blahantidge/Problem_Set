On this deal, can partner help without holding a single point?

<Badge type="tip" text="Defense"/>

## The Auction

<table class="hand">
	<tr>
		<td>♠ J763<br>♥ T654<br>♦ K5<br>♣ AQ6</td>
	</tr>
</table>

Suppose you are sitting South. Both sides are vulnerable. East is the dealer and opens 1♥. You have to decide what call to make after this start.

You have the values for an opening bid - 12 high-card points plus 2 length points for the six-card diamond suit. With a good suit, you have enough to overcall at the two level, even vulnerable.

West bids 3♣. You partner, North, passes, and East rebids 3♥. You have to decide what call to make after this development.

Having already overcalled at the two level and, with partner showing no interest in competing, you have done enough. You pass.

West now raises to 4♥. Partner and East both pass, and the auction is back to you.

Naturally, you pass, ending the auction.

East is now the declarer in 4♥, and you have to choose an opening lead.

## The Opening Lead

The choice of opening lead is fairly straightforward. With a long suit headed by the ace-king, there is no reason to lead anything else.

## Possible Defense

You lead the ♦A, and dummy comes down.

Declarer plays a low diamond from dummy, partner plays the ♦6, and declarer follows with the ♦4. What next?

There doesn't seem to be any reason not to continue with the ♦K. Partner's ♦6 could be a singleton, low from three diamonds, or even low from a doubleton ♦Q. You play the ♦K, dummy follows with the ♦J, partner with the ♦9, and declarer with the ♦Q. Partner's low-high in diamonds indicates that partner started with three diamonds. You aren't getting any more tricks from diamonds. So, what are you going to do next?

You already have two tricks and you are assured of a third trick with the ♥A. Where is the fourth defensive trick coming from?

With the strong club suit in dummy, it looks as though the only possibility is that partner has the ♠A. Let's see what will happen if you hope for that.

Suppose you switch to the ♠J. Declarer plays low from dummy, partner plays low, and declarer wins the ♠A. So much for that hope. Declarer starts drawing trumps by leading the ♥J. It looks as though the only hope now is that partner has the ♥K. You don't want to play the ♥A in case partner has the singleton ♥K. You play low, and so do dummy and partner. No heart winner from partner. Declarer continues with the ♥Q. No point in playing low this time, so you win the ♥A as both dummy and partner follow with low hearts.

Nothing much to do except lead another spade. Perhaps declarer will forget that you still have a trump remaining and lead a third round of spades. Dummy's ♠K wins the trick. Declarer draws your last trump as partner discards a low club. So much for hoping you would get to ruff a spade.

Declarer has the rest of the tricks. With partner holding not a single face card, it doesn't look as though there was anything you could do to defeat the contract.

When this actual deal was played, sitting South was George Healy, editor of the New Orleans Times-Picayune. Let's see what happened when Healy was defending the contract.

## The Actual Defense

George Healy led the ♦A, winning the first trick. He continued with the ♦K, winning the second trick. At this point, he stopped to consider how the partnership could get a fourth trick.

Could partner hold the ♠A?

He decided that wasn't possible. He had started with 12 high-card points, dummy had 15 high-card points, and declarer presumably started with at least 12 high-card points. Partner could have at most 1 high-card point.

So, instead of hoping for something partner couldn't hold, he decided to play for something partner could hold - the ♥J or ♥10.

He led a third round of diamonds!

Declarer had no diamonds in either hand, and this gave declarer a ruff and a sluff, usually a bad idea. Declarer ruffed in dummy with a low heart and discarded a spade. Since declarer presumably held the ♠A, that really didn't help declarer at all.

Declarer started drawing trumps by leading a heart to the ♥K. Healy immediately won the ♥A. What next?

Healy led another diamond!

Declarer ruffed with dummy's ♥7, but North then overruffed with the card Healy was hoping to see, the ♥10. Declarer had to overruff with the ♥J to win the trick.

Declarer led the ♥Q, hoping both defenders' remaining hearts would fall on this trick. Healy followed suit but his partner showed out. Healy's ♥9 had suddenly been promoted into the highest remaining heart.

Declarer had all the other tricks, but, sooner or later, was going to lose a trick to the ♥9. Down one. The defense had taken two diamond tricks and two heart tricks.

## The Rest of the Story

</table>

The technique George Healy used to defeat the contract was an uppercut. By continuing to lead diamonds, his partner was able to ruff the fourth round with the critical ♥10. This dealt a blow to declarer's holding since declarer was forced to overruff with a high heart, promoting Healy's ♥9 into a winner.
