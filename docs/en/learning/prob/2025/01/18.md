On this deal, will the odds impact how you play the cards?

<Badge type="warning" text="Play"/>

## The Auction

<table class="hand">
	<tr>
		<td>♠ A83<br>♥ AK74<br>♦ J95<br>♣ QJT</td>
	</tr>
</table>

Suppose you are sitting South on this deal. Neither side is vulnerable. Partner, North, is the dealer and opens 1♣. East passes, and you have to choose a response.

With 15 high-card points, you have more than enough to take the partnership to game. The first priority, however, is to look for a major-suit fit. So you respond 1♥.

West passes, and partner raises to 2♥. East passes, and the auction is back to you.

Partner's raise shows support for hearts and a minimum-strength hand of about 13-16 points. Partner will typically have four-card support but could have three-card support and a hand unsuitable for rebidding 1NT. There are various ways a partnership can check back to find out if partner has four-card support. Responder can bid a new suit or jump to 3NT, giving partner a choice between 3NT and 4♥.

A new suit will initially be interpreted by partner as a help suit game try, although you plan to continue to game anyway. With a partial fit for clubs and no sure stopper in diamonds, you can keep things simple by jumping to 4♥. Let's go with that.

Everyone passes, and you are now the declarer in 4♥ with West on lead.

## Planning the Play

West leads the ♥10, and partner puts down the dummy.

Partner does have only three hearts, so you are in a 4-3 trump fit.

Would you be better off in 3NT?

Hard to tell. The opponents might be able to take the first five or six diamond tricks. Anyway, it's too late to be concerned about that now. You need to focus on taking ten tricks to make your contract.

You start by considering the potential losers. There will be no heart losers if the six missing hearts are divided 3-3. However, that's against the odds. If the hearts divide 4-2, you will have one loser. If they are divided 5-1 or 6-0... best not to think about that. You will be left with a potential spade loser after the ♠A and ♠K are gone. You don't have any club losers, but you do have three potential diamond losers in your hand. Assuming you have a heart loser, that's five potential losers: a heart, a spade, and three diamonds. That's two more than you can afford.

You can avoid the heart loser if the defenders' hearts are divided 3-3.

You will be able to discard the spade loser on one of dummy's extra club winners.

You could plan on ruffing a diamond loser in dummy after giving up two diamond tricks. Alternatively, you could plan to discard at least one diamond on dummy's extra club winners after trumps are drawn.

So there are a couple of possibilities.

Let's see how the play might start off.

## Possible Play

West has led the ♥10. So you are immediately faced with a decision. Should you simply draw the defenders' trumps?

If they are divided 3-3, you will make an overtrick. Let's see if that will work on this deal.

Suppose you win the first trick with dummy's ♥Q. East follows with a low heart, so that's two of the defenders' hearts gone. You continue with a heart to the ♥K. Both defenders again follow suit. So far, so good. That's four of the defenders' trumps gone. There are only two left. You play the ♥A, but unfortunately West shows out. That's too bad. The defenders' hearts have divided 4-2 and East still has a high heart remaining.

You will still be fine if you can discard a diamond on one of dummy's extra club winners. Both defenders follow when you play the ♣Q. Both defenders also follow when you continue with the ♣J. You try a third round of clubs, overtaking in dummy. You will be okay if this trick wins since you will then be able to discard one of your diamonds. Unfortunately, West is the one who follows to the club and East shows out, ruffing with the defenders' last trump.

East has no problem switching to the ♦A. East takes another trick with the ♦Q.

You would be okay if East didn't have any more diamonds to lead but, sadly, East has another diamond and West wins the trick with the ♦K. That's the fourth trick for the defense, and the 4♥ contract is down one. So trying to draw the defenders' trumps doesn't seem to work.

Let's go back to the first trick.

## Another Possible Play

Trying to draw all the defenders' trumps doesn't work, but you don't want to start taking club winners until trumps are drawn.

West has led the ♥10.

Perhaps you should plan on ruffing a diamond in dummy. Then the defenders won't be able to take three diamond tricks when they gain the lead. Let's see if that will work.

Suppose you again win the first trick with dummy's ♥Q. Next, you lead a diamond from dummy, giving up a trick to the opponents. West wins the trick.

West now shifts to a spade. You choose to win this in your hand. Well, at least West didn't lead another heart, threatening to remove dummy's trumps before you could ruff a diamond. You give up another diamond trick. East wins this time.

East leads another spade which you win with dummy's ♠K. You get to your hand with a heart. You then ruff your diamond loser in dummy. At least the defenders won't get three diamond tricks if they gain the lead. You come back to your hand with a club. You play another high trump, getting the bad news that the trumps didn't divide 3-3. Too bad. If they had, you would have the rest of the tricks.

The best you can do now is to start taking the club winners, hoping to get rid of your spade loser. Both defenders follow to the second round of clubs. As before, however, when you lead the third round of clubs, East ruffs with the ♥J.

East can't take a diamond trick, but this time East can take a spade trick. Down one again. So trying to draw all the trumps doesn't work and trying to ruff a diamond in dummy doesn't work.

When this actual deal was played in the 1954 European Bridge Championships between Great Britain and Norway, sitting South as declarer was Terence Reese of Great Britain, playing with Boris Schapiro. Let's see how Reese handled the deal.

## The Actual Play

West led the ♥10.

Terence Reese was aware that the odds of the missing hearts being divided 3-3 were much less likely than being divided 4-2. He also knew he couldn't take all the club winners until the trumps were drawn. So he made a simple, but elegant, play at trick one.

He played low hearts from both hands, letting West's ♥10 win the first trick!

What could the defenders do?

If West continued with another heart, Reese could draw all the trumps and take the club and spade winners to make the contract. Similarly, if West switched to a spade or a club, Reese would win, draw trumps, and take his winners.

So West could do no better than switch to a diamond, which East won with
the ♦A. East took another diamond trick, but that was all for the defense. If East led a third diamond, Reese could ruff in dummy with the low heart.

East led a spade, which Reese won. Reese then played three rounds of trumps, drawing all the defenders' remaining trumps, even though they were originally divided 4-2. He could safely take all the club winners, discarding the diamond and spade losers from his hand.

The ♠K was his tenth trick. He had made the 4♥ contract, losing only a heart and two diamonds.

Terence Reese merely used good technique to make the contract. He knew a heart trick would have to be lost if the defenders' hearts were divided 4-2 and, if that was the case, it was best to lose it early while he still had complete command of the hand. Losing the first trick was a safety play, protecting against the hearts being divided 4-2 and maintaining control of the hand.

The British team won the match against Norway and subsequently went on to win the European championship.

Reese won the European championships four times and won the Bermuda Bowl World Championship in 1965. He represented Britain on many other occasions and won the Gold Cup - the premier British team event - eight times. It was a record that was only surpassed by his frequent partner, Boris Schapiro.

Reese was brought up playing cards. His parents met at a social Whist drive and, at the age of three, before he could read, he became addicted to beggar-my-neighbor, a popular card game. At age seven, he was introduced to Auction Bridge, the forerunner to Contract Bridge. He first came into the public eye when he captained the Oxford bridge team in a win over Cambridge in 1935.

Reese made his last public appearance at the Macallan International Pairs in London in 1966. He attended the formal closing dinner - a black-tie affair - wearing a checkered shirt and a sports jacket. Nobody minded or was surprised.
