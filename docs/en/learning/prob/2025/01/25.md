On this deal, you have possible finesses in all four suits. Is that good enough?

## The Auction

<table class="hand">
	<tr>
		<td>♠ 86<br>♥ K64<br>♦ AK7<br>♣ KJ975</td>
	</tr>
</table>

Suppose you are the dealer sitting South on this deal. Your side is vulnerable and the opponents are not. You have to choose an opening call with this hand.

The hand is balanced with 14 high-card points plus 1 length point for the five-card club suit. You might open 1♣. However, in the modern style, some players will open 1NT, showing 15-17 points. Let's go with making the 1NT opening bid.

West passes. Partner, North, responds 2♥ which you have agreed to play as a Jacoby transfer bid, showing a five-card or longer spade suit. East passes. What should you do?

Partner's strength is unknown and partner has asked you to bid 2♠. You don't much care for spades but need to comply with partner's request. Partner might have a very weak hand with a long spade suit.

West passes, and partner jumps to 4♠. East passes, and the auction is back to you.

Naturally, with a minimum notrump opening, you pass.

West passes, and you are now the declarer in 4♠ with West on lead.

## Planning the Play

West leads the ♠7, and partner puts down the dummy.

<table class="deal">
	<tr>
		<td></td>
		<td>♠ AQJT542<br>♥ 98<br>♦ JT8<br>♣ 2</td>
		<td></td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>♠ <br>♥ <br>♦ <br>♣ </td>
		<td><pre>   N<br>W     E<br>   S</pre></td>
		<td>♠ <br>♥ <br>♦ <br>♣ </td>

	</tr>

Partner has 8 high-card points plus 3 length points for the seven-card suit, enough to go for game opposite a 1NT opening.

The first step in your suit contract is to count the potential losers. There is one potential spade loser since you are missing the ♠K. You have three potential heart losers in your hand since the opponents have all the high hearts other than the ♥K. You have five potential club losers in your hand since you are missing the ♣A-Q-10-8-6. There is also a potential diamond loser since you are missing the ♦Q. That's a total of ten potential losers, seven more than you can afford!

Whenever you count a large number of losers from your perspective, it's often easier to consider things from dummy's perspective, especially when dummy has the long trumps. Looked at from dummy's perspective, you have a spade loser, two heart losers, a club loser, and a diamond loser. That's only five losers... much better. You need to eliminate only two losers.

You might be able to avoid a spade loser with the help of one or more finesses if West holds the ♠K. West has led a spade, which might make you suspect East is more likely to hold the ♠K than West. However, the odds favor taking the finesse rather than hoping East started with a singleton ♠K. Also, West might have led from three or more spades, including the ♠K, knowing the ♠K will still take a trick if you hold the ♠A.

Similarly, you might be able to avoid a heart loser wih the help of a finesse by leading toward the ♥K, hoping East holds the ♥A. That's a 50% chance.

There is also a 50% chance to eliminate the diamond loser with the help of a finesse. If East holds the ♦Q, you can trap it by leading the ♦J or ♦10 from dummy.

There is also the possibility of creating an extra club winner in your hand on which you can discard either a heart or diamond loser from dummy. You can lead the singleton club from dummy and guess whether to play the ♣K or ♣J from your hand if East plays a low club. If East holds the ♣Q and West the ♣A, for example, you can play the forcing West to win the ♣A and establishing your ♣K as a winner.

So there are finesses that can be taken in all four suits. If two of them work, you can eliminate two losers and make the contract.

Let's see how the play might start off.

## Possible Play

West has led the ♠7. You've already decided the spade finesse offers a better chance of avoiding a loser than playing the ♠A and hoping East has a singleton ♠K. So let's suppose you play the ♠10 from dummy. It wins as East follows with the ♠3. So it appears the spade finesse is working, unless East has made the unlikely play of holding up with the ♠K. That's one of the finesses you needed. What next?

You want to repeat the spade finesse, but you are in the wrong hand. Since you are in dummy, you can try establishing an extra club winner. Let's go with that. Suppose you lead the singleton club from dummy. East plays a low club. Since East might have chosen to play the when holding it, let's assume you try the ♣J, hoping East holds the ♣Q and West the ♣A. Unfortunately, West wins with the ♣Q. So much for that chance.

West now leads the ♠K. You win dummy's ♠A as East shows out, discarding a heart. At least that's one finesse you know has worked. There is a still a spade outstanding, so you might as well get rid of it. You play dummy's ♠Q, East discards a diamond, you discard a club, and West follows with the defenders' last trump. Now what?

It seems reasonable to try one of the other finesses. Suppose you lead a heart from dummy. East plays the ♥J, you try the ♥K, but West wins the ♥A. So much for that chance.

West takes a trick with the ♥Q. That's the third trick for the defense. You can't afford to lose any more. West leads another heart and you ruff in dummy.

Your last chance appears to be the diamond finesse. Suppose you lead the ♦J from dummy. East plays low, and you play low. Unfortunately, West wins with the ♦Q.

You have the rest of the tricks, but 4♠ is down one. You lost a club, two hearts, and a diamond. The spade finesse worked, but all the others lost.

When this actual deal was played during the South American Open Bridge Team Championships in Santiago, Chile, sitting South as declarer was Mustafa Cem Tokay, playing with Giovanni Donati. Tokay and Donati played a form of Texas transfers in the auction, but they also arrived at the same contract of 4♠. How did Tokay handle the unlucky lie of the cards on this deal?

Let's see.

## The Actual Play

Mustafa Cem Tokay got the same opening lead of the ♠7. He tried dummy's ♠10, and it won the first trick as East followed with a low spade. He led the club from dummy, trying to establish a club winner on which to discard a heart or a diamond loser. When East played a low club, he tried the ♣J, but this lost to West's ♣Q. West led the ♠K, putting Tokay back in dummy with the ♠A. West obviously didn't want to lead a heart, a club, or a diamond, any of which would have helped declarer. East showed out, discarding a heart. Tokay drew West's last trump with the ♠Q as East discarded a diamond.

At this point, he decided there was no hurry to take either the heart or diamond finesse. There was still the possibility of developing a club winner. He crossed to his hand with the ♦A. He was pretty sure West held the ♣A since East played low when the singleton club was led from dummy. If that were the case, he could see a way to guarantee the contract.

He led the ♣K out of his hand.

As he expected, West played the ♣A. Tokay then made a surprising play.

He let West's ♣A win the trick!

He discarded a heart from dummy.

Let's see the remaining cards to see why the contract was then secure.

Here are the remaining cards with West on lead.

<table class="deal">
	<tr>
		<td></td>
		<td>♠ J542<br>♥ 9<br>♦ JT<br>♣ </td>
		<td></td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>♠ <br>♥ AQ32<br>♦ Q9<br>♣ 8</td>
		<td><pre>   N<br>W     E<br>   S</pre></td>
		<td>♠ <br>♥ JT5<br>♦ 54<br>♣ T6</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td></td>
		<td>♠ <br>♥ K64<br>♦ K7<br>♣ 97</td>
		<td></td>
	</tr>
</table>

What could West do?

If West led a heart, declarer would get a trick with the ♥K. If West led a diamond, declarer wouldn't lose a diamond trick. And what if West led a club?

Tokay could discard a heart from dummy. East could win with the ♣10, but that established declarer's ♣9 as a winner.

Whatever East returned, Tokay could win. The ♦K was a winner. No need to risk a finesse. Tokay could play the ♣9, discarding dummy's last diamond.

He had the rest of the tricks with dummy's trumps. 4♠ was made, losing only three club tricks!

As Fernando Lama said when reporting this deal, "Mustafa Cem Tokay showed excellent card play technique with a touch of subtle elegance." He judged from West's trump lead that West likely had most of the missing high cards and was trying to find a safe lead. He then managed to end play West, by putting West on lead with no safe exit.

Mustafa Cem Tokay was born in Turkey. Surprisingly, not only is he a Turkish national champion but also a South American national champion, having won the 2014 Open Teams Championship.

Having lived in Rome, he also played with many of the top Italian players. He won the Copenhagen Invitational Pairs playing with Alfredo Versace of Italy.

When asked whether he would again choose a bridge career if he were born again, he replied, "Yes! Of course... I would choose bridge again 100%. This game has unlimited possibilities and there are human feelings inside it, so it is a real passion for me."
