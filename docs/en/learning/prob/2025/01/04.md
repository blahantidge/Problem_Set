You have a critical decision to make early in the deal.

<Badge type="warning" text="Play"/>

## The Auction

<table class="hand">
	<tr>
		<td>♠ KJT96543<br>♥ AJ2<br>♦ K7<br>♣ </td>
	</tr>
</table>

Let's suppose you are sitting South on this deal with both sides vulnerable. West is the dealer and opens 1♥. Your partner, North, makes a takeout double, and East passes. You must decide what call to make with your impressive hand.

This is an amazingly strong hand to be holding in this auction. Partner is showing support for spades, diamonds, and clubs, and opening bid values or better. You have a good eight-card spade suit, the ace of the opponent's suit, the ♦K, and a void in clubs. It's hard to imagine what partner could hold that wouldn't give you at least a play for twelve tricks. You could start with a cuebid of the opponent's suit, but you're never going to be able to describe this hand to partner. Hands with voids are notoriously difficult to bid since you can't use the Blackwood convention. So it appears the most practical call is a jump right to 6♠. Let's go with that.

After you fearlessly jump to 6♠, everyone passes. You are now the declarer in a small slam.

## Planning the Play

West leads the ♣K, and partner puts down the dummy.

	</tr>
	<tr>

At least you aren't missing two aces and you also don't belong in a grand slam.

As declarer in a suit contract, you begin by counting the potential losers. There are no spade losers. That's a very solid suit. You have the top twelve cards! There are two potential heart losers after your ♥A is gone. There are no club losers. In fact, you have an extra winner on which you can discard a loser. However, you have a diamond loser since you are missing the ♦A. That's a total of three losers and you can afford only one.

Eliminating one of the heart losers is easy. You could discard a heart on dummy's ♣A. Or you could give up a heart and ruff your third heart in dummy. Unfortunately, when you give up a heart trick, the defenders will take their ♦A. Is there any way to avoid losing both a heart and a diamond trick?

Let's see how the play might start off.

## Possible Play

West has led the ♣K. Right away, you are faced with a critical decision. Should you win the first trick with dummy's ♣A?

Let's see what will happen if you do.

If you win the ♣A, East follows with a low club, but now you are faced with a challenging decision. What should you discard on the ♣A?

Suppose you discard a diamond. You are still left with a diamond loser. Even though you can promote dummy's ♦Q into a winner, you can only discard one heart on it.

You'll still be left with a heart loser. Down one.

Let's go back and look at another possibility.

## Another Possible Play

West has led the ♣K.

Suppose instead you discard a heart on dummy's ♣A.

Unfortunately, you are still left with both a diamond loser and a heart loser. Down one again.

What else can you do?

## Recommended Play

This is an actual deal that was set up in the concourse of London's busy Waterloo station. The two men sitting at the table offered curious commuters the opportunity to win the latest, and most sophisticated, bridge computer if they could find the winning play on the deal. So let's see how declarer should handle the play.

As you've just seen, it won't help to win dummy's ♣A at trick one. Whether you discard a diamond or a heart, you will still be left with two losers. Let's see what will happen if you don't play dummy's ♣A at trick one.

You play a low club from dummy at trick one. East also plays a low club, and you ruff to win the trick. Now what?

It can't hurt to draw the defenders' trump. There's only one missing. You play a high spade. West follows with the missing ♠2, and East discards a low club. That takes care of the trumps. What next?

West opened the bidding and presumably has most of the missing high cards. It won't do any good to give up a heart trick. West will win and take a trick with the ♦A. It also won't do any good to lead the ♦K. West will win the ♦A and eventually get a heart trick. What's left?

Lead your low diamond!

What can West do?

If West plays a low diamond, you win the trick with dummy's ♦Q. What now?

You can play dummy's ♣A and discard your ♦K. You no longer have a diamond loser. You win a trick with the ♥A. You can safely give up a heart trick.

You can now ruff your last heart in dummy and have the rest of the tricks. You lost only one heart trick.

But what if West had taken the ♦A when you led the low diamond?

Let's see.

## Another Possible Scenario

You ruff the first trick with a low spade in your hand. You draw the outstanding trump.

You now lead a low diamond. Let's see what will happen if West takes the ♦A instead of playing low.

Suppose West wins the ♦A to prevent you from getting away with losing no diamond tricks. You play a low diamond from dummy. West belatedly shifts to a heart, East plays the ♥Q, and you win the ♥A. You take your ♦K winner. Next, you cross to dummy with a spade. On dummy's ♦Q, you discard one of your heart losers. And on dummy's ♣A, you discard your remaining heart loser.

You have the rest of the tricks, making the 6♠ contract. You lost only a diamond trick.

## The Rest of the Story

<table class="deal">
	<tr>
		<td></td>
		<td>♠ AQ87<br>♥ 54<br>♦ Q32<br>♣ A973</td>
		<td></td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>♠ 2<br>♥ KT983<br>♦ AJ8<br>♣ KQT2</td>
		<td><pre>   N<br>W     E<br>   S</pre></td>
		<td>♠ <br>♥ Q76<br>♦ T9654<br>♣ J8654</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td></td>
		<td>♠ KJT96543<br>♥ AJ2<br>♦ K7<br>♣ </td>
		<td></td>
	</tr>
</table>

When you lead a low diamond toward dummy, West has no winning play. If West plays low, you win the ♦Q and your diamond loser goes away on dummy's ♣A. If West plays the ♦A, you can then discard both heart losers on dummy's ♦Q and ♣A.

The technical name for this type of play is a Morton's Fork Coup. It is named after Cardinal John Morton, the zealous collector of taxes for King Henry VII. He argued that rich people who lived lavishly could afford to pay taxes, and poor people who lived modestly must have plenty of savings with which to pay taxes.

There was no way to avoid Morton's fork.

The two people who set up the table in the busy Waterloo station were British bridge experts Victor Mollo and Jeremy Flint. They challenged travelers to play specially prepared deals. Flint later wrote about the experience and some of the deals in his bridge columns in The Times.
