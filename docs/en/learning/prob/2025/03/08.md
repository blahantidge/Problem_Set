On this deal, have you got a little too high?

## The Auction

<table class="hand">
	<tr>
		<td>♠ KQJT53<br>♥ 7<br>♦ 942<br>♣ A73</td>
	</tr>
</table>

This deal was played in the 1979 International Bridge Festival in Deauville, France. Sitting North-South were Canada's top international pair, Eric Murray and Sami Kehela. With both sides vulnerable, East was the dealer and opened 1♥. Kehela, holding the South cards, had to decide what call to make.

There were 10 high-card points plus 2 length points for the six-card spade suit. In today's game, some players might make a preemptive jump overcall of 2♠ with this hand. Even vulnerable, however, the hand was a little strong for that. Let's go with a simple 1♠ overcall. Besides, at the time this deal was played, 2♠ would have been an intermediate jump overcall, showing a very good hand.

West raised to 2♥ and Murray cuebid 3♥, showing a good hand for spades and interest in at least game. East then bid 4♦. The auction was back to Kehela.

With a much better hand than he might have had for a 1♠ overcall, Kehela accepted partner's invitation and bid 4♠.

The auction, however, wasn't over. West passed, and Murray bid 5♦. This was showing interest in slam. East passed, and Kehela had to decide what to do.

Kehela had a pretty good hand given the original one-level overcall: solid spades, a singleton heart, and the ♣A. He decided to jump to 6♠.

Everyone passed, and Kehela was the declarer in 6♠.

## Planning the Play

Before we see how Kehela managed the play, let's suppose you are the declarer in the South position and have to find a way to take twelve tricks.

West leads the ♥J, and partner puts down the dummy.

Partner has 17 high-card points plus 1 dummy point for the doubleton heart, but it looks like you may have got a little too high.

You start your plan by considering the potential losers in 6♠. You don't have any losers in spades, hearts, or clubs. However, you will be left with two potential diamond losers once dummy's ♦A is gone. You can afford only one loser.

It looks as though your only possibility for eliminating one of the diamond losers is to discard it on an extra club winner. For that to happen, you need the defenders' six clubs to be divided exactly 3-3. That's against the odds, but let's see how the play might start off.

## Possible Play

West has led the ♥J and you win the first trick with the ♥A. There's no reason to delay drawing the defenders' trumps. You play a spade to the ♠K, and both defenders follow suit. There's still one spade outstanding. You continue with a spade to dummy ♠A. West follows with the defenders' last spade and East discards a high diamond.

You might as well find out if the defenders' clubs are divided 3-3. You lead a low club to the ♣A. Both defenders follow suit. You continue with a club to dummy's ♣Q. West follows suit, but East shows out. That's not too unexpected since East bid hearts and diamonds during the auction. You take a trick with the ♣K. You ruff dummy's last club. You cross back to dummy with the ♦A. You ruff dummy's last heart.

But all you can do now is lead a diamond and hope that the defender who wins the trick makes a mistake and leads a heart, allowing you to ruff in one hand and sluff your remaining diamond loser from the other hand. East wins the trick.

Unfortunately, East takes another diamond trick, and the 6♠ contract is down one. With clubs failing to break, it doesn't look as though you can avoid the two diamond losers.

So how did Sami Kehela play the contract?

## The Actual Play

Sami Kehela got the same opening lead of the ♥J and won the first trick with the ♥A. He immediately led dummy's remaining heart and ruffed it. He wanted to eliminate the hearts from the combined hands so that it would not be safe for the defenders to lead a heart when they gained the lead.

He then started drawing the defenders' trumps. Both defenders followed to the first round of spades. He drew the defenders' remaining trump as East discarded an encouraging diamond.

Kehela then turned his attention to the club suit. He was pretty sure the suit wasn't going to be dividing 3-3 since East had bid hearts and then bid diamonds at the four level, showing a lot of red cards. However, there was nothing to be lost in trying. Both defenders followed to the first round of clubs. As expected, East showed out on the second round of clubs. Kehela took dummy's last club winner.

He considered whether there was any way to make the contract at this point. Given that East had bid diamonds at the four level, he decided it was possible that East had started with a six-card diamond suit. That would leave West with only a singleton diamond. If that were the case, he still had a chance.

He took a trick with dummy's ♦A.

He had to hope that removed West's only diamond.

He then led dummy's last club and made another key play.

East discarded another diamond and... Kehela discarded one of his diamond losers. West won the trick.

As Kehela hoped, West had no diamonds left to lead. Instead, he had to lead either a heart or a club. Whichever he led, Kehela could ruff in dummy and discard the remaining diamond loser from his hand. A ruff and a sluff.

He had the rest of the tricks with his remaining trumps. He had made the 6♠ contract, losing a club trick but no diamond tricks.

East had chosen to open 1♥ with five hearts and six diamonds. East had a distributional hand but not enough strength to reverse from diamonds into hearts. Kehela couldn't be sure that was East's distribution, but it was his only chance to make the impossible-looking slam contract.

Sami Kehela lives in Canada but, in the 1950s, he lived in Great Britain. He would play bridge regularly for money at Lederer's Club in London.

A member of both the American and Canadian Hall of Fame, Kehela and his long-time partner, Eric Murray, are considered the two best Canadian players of all time. Between 1966 and 1974, the pair was on the Silver Medal team in three Bermuda Bowls. Unique among world players, they represented Canada in each of the first six World Team Olympiads.

Kehela considered one of his major accomplishments being able to handle Murray's notorious penchant for overbidding. "I listened to the opponents' bidding and believed them, not my partner," explained Kehela. "It worked during the 30 years of our partnership."
