On this deal, you can't afford to lose more than one trump trick. Is that possible?

## The Auction

<table class="hand">
	<tr>
		<td>♠ J62<br>♥ Q876<br>♦ JT93<br>♣ Q5</td>
	</tr>
</table>

On this deal, suppose you are sitting South. Both sides are vulnerable. West is the dealer and passes. Your partner, North, opens 1♦. East passes. You have to decide what to respond.

You have only 6 high-card points, but that's enough to respond and keep the auction going in case partner has a strong hand. Although you have support for partner's diamond suit, the priority is to look for an eight-card major-suit fit. So you respond 1♥.

West now comes to life with a jump to 2NT. This is the unusual 2NT overcall, showing a weak, distributional hand, with five-card or longer support for the two unbid suits, clubs and spades. Partner jumps to 4♥, and East passes. The auction is back to you.

You've done enough with the 1♥ response and have no reason to bid again.

West passes, ending the auction. You are now the declarer in 4♥ with West on lead.

## Planning the Play

West leads the ♦5, and partner puts down the dummy.

<table class="deal">
	<tr>
		<td></td>
		<td>♠ AQ<br>♥ KT54<br>♦ AQ64<br>♣ A72</td>
		<td></td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>♠ <br>♥ <br>♦ <br>♣ </td>
		<td><pre>   N<br>W     E<br>   S</pre></td>
		<td>♠ <br>♥ <br>♦ <br>♣ </td>
	</tr>
	<tr>

North certainly has a sound raise to 4♥ with four-card support and 19 high-card points plus 1 dummy point for the doubleton spade.

The first step in your plan is to consider the potential losers in 4♥. You have at least two potential heart losers since you are missing the ♥A and ♥J. You could conceivably lose more if the hearts don't divide 3-2 since you are also missing the ♥9. There is a potential spade loser since you are missing the ♠K. There is a potential diamond loser since you are missing the ♦K. There will also be a club loser remaining in your hand once the ♣A is gone. That's at least five potential losers: two hearts, a spade, a diamond, and a club. Two more than you can afford.

To avoid a second heart loser, there are various ways to handle the heart suit. The straightforward approach is to hope the defenders' hearts are divided 3-2 and West holds the ♥J, Then, if necessary, you can take a finesse of dummy's ♥10 to trap West's ♥J. There are other possibilities. For example, if West started with a singleton ♥9 or ♥J, you can avoid a heart loser by starting with a high heart from dummy. Alternatively, if West holds a doubleton ♥A, you could lead a low heart to dummy's ♥K and then play a low heart from both hands. Choosing how to handle the hearts is likely to be critical on this deal.

To avoid the spade loser, you can start by trying the spade finesse, hoping West holds the ♠K. That's reasonably likely to work since West showed both spades and clubs with the unusual 2NT overcall. However, you will still be left with a third spade in your hand to deal with. You could plan to ruff it in dummy or perhaps discard it on an extra winner if you can create one.

To avoid a diamond loser, you could try the diamond finesse, hoping West holds the ♦K. Is that likely to work on this deal?

No. West has led the ♦5. Since West has shown at least five cards in spades and five cards in clubs during the auction, it's unlikely West has length in diamonds. The ♦5 is presumably a singleton or top of a doubleton.

Unless a defender holds a singleton ♣K, you can't avoid the club loser. You might be able to develop an extra club winner if East holds the ♣K by leading toward the ♣Q. However, West is more likely to hold the ♣K since West showed length in both spades and clubs during the auction.

So the play is likely to be complex. You almost certainly have a heart, a diamond, and a club loser. You are going to need to avoid a second heart loser and a spade loser.

Let's see how the play might go.

## Possible Play

West has led the ♦5. You immediately have your first decision. Should you try the diamond finesse?

You've already determined from the auction West is likely short in diamonds. You don't want to go down right away by having East win the ♦K and give West a ruff. So let's assume you win the ♦A. East makes an encouraging signal with the ♦8. What now?

You want to draw the defenders' trumps as quickly as possible so West doesn't get a diamond ruff. You have another critical decision. How are you going to start playing the heart suit?

It seems reasonable to start by leading a low heart toward your hand, planning to play the ♥Q. If West holds the ♥A, West may not be able to get to East's hand for a ruff, and you could then plan to lead toward dummy's ♥K-10, hoping West has the ♥J. Let's see what will happen on the actual deal.

Suppose you lead a low heart from dummy. East plays a low heart and you play the ♥Q. This wins the trick as West follows with the ♥J. That's good news and bad news. You aren't going to lose a trick to the ♥J, but East must have started with four hearts, including the ♥A and ♥9. Unfortunately, there's not much you can do at this point. Since West presumably has no hearts remaining, it's safe to drive out East's ♦K to establish your remaining diamonds as winners.

East leads a club, and you can try the ♣Q. As you expected, however, West produces the ♣K. Let's suppose you let West win this trick.

West continues with another club, and you win dummy's ♣A. You can drive out East's ♥A. As you expected, West shows out.

East leads a diamond, which you win. You try the spade finesse, which works. As you expected, West holds the ♠K. You draw one of East's remaining trumps with the ♥10. However, East still has the ♥9. You take your spade and diamond winners.

Eventually, however, East gets a trick with the ♥9, and the 4♥ contract is down one. You lost a diamond, a club, and two heart tricks.

With the hearts breaking 4-1 and West threatening to ruff a diamond, was there anything you could have done?

When this actual deal was played in the final match of the 1986 Europa Cup, sitting South was Mihaly Kovacs of Hungary. Let's see what Kovacs did.

## The Actual Play

Sitting North-South for Hungary were Miklos Dumbovich and Mihaly Kovacs. Sitting East-West for France were Michel Lebel and Omar Sharif. Against Kovacs' 4♥ contract, Sharif led the ♦5. From the auction and the choice of the opening lead, Kovacs knew it would not be a good idea to try the diamond finesse. So he won the first trick with the ♦A.

Kovacs knew he couldn't afford to lose two heart tricks. If the hearts were divided 3-2 and East held the ♥A, he couldn't prevent the defenders from getting a diamond ruff. If West held the ♥A, he might be able to drive it out and avoid losing a second heart trick if West also held the ♥J. But could West hold the ♥A?

Kovacs decided it was unlikely. Sharif had shown spades and clubs with the unusual 2NT overcall during the auction and likely held both the ♠K and ♣K. However, Sharif had passed originally. Would Sharif have passed with two five-card suits headed by the king and also the ♥A?

Kovacs didn't think so. If East held the ♥A, the only hope was that Sharif had started with a singleton heart. If it was a low heart, then East started with four hearts headed by the ♥A-J-9 and East would always get two heart tricks.

So he found the only winning possibility at trick two.

He led the ♥K from dummy!

East won with the ♥A, but West's singleton ♥J fell on this trick. It would also have been okay if West started with the singleton ♥9. East switched to a club. Kovacs tried the ♣Q but, as expected, West played the ♣K. Since a club trick had to be lost, Kovacs let West win this trick.

West continued with another club, and Kovacs won dummy's ♣A. He then led a heart from dummy and, when East followed with a low heart, finessed the ♥7. Next, he drove out East's ♦K.

East returned a diamond, which Kovacs won. He tried the spade finesse by leading a low spade to dummy's ♠Q, winning the trick. He took dummy's diamond winner. He didn't want East to be able to discard a diamond when he subsequently led a club. At that point, he led dummy's last club. It wouldn't do East any good to ruff since Kovacs would simply overruff. East discarded a spade, and Kovacs ruffed with the low heart. He played the ♥Q, drawing one of East's remaining trumps. He crossed back to dummy with the ♠A. Kovacs could finally play dummy's ♥10, drawing East's remaining ♥9.

He had made the 4♥ contract, losing only a diamond, a club, and only one heart trick.

Once Kovacs determined that his only hope was for West to hold a singleton ♥J or ♥9, he played as if that were the lie of the cards and was rewarded for his foresight.

Despite his fine play on this deal, however, Omar Sharif and the rest of the French team went on to win the final and the Europa Cup.

![](/image/2025/03/15/Sharif.png){style="margin: 0 auto"}

The Europa Cup was started in 1979 and sponsored by Philip Morris. It was meant to be a competition among the national club champions of each country in the European Bridge League. Unfortunately, many countries did not hold inter-club competitions and simply sent their national teams instead. This created an uneven playing field, so the event was ultimately discontinued after 1988 and revived with a different format as the European Champions' Cup starting in 2002.

Mihaly Kovacs has long been one of Hungary's leading bridge stars. In 2008, he was on the team that won the Senior World Championship at the 14th World Bridge Games. It was the first time a Hungarian team had won a world championship. Hungary's previous best results had been winning the European championships in 1934 and 1938.

In the final of the Europa Cup match, the Hungarian team handily defeated the American team by a score of 247-166. When Kovacs went back to his hotel room after winning the event, the phone rang. When he picked it up, the voice on the other end of the line said, "Hi, this is Barack Obama. I just called to congratulate you on your big win."

The team's win set off celebrations all over Hungary. Hungarian President Janos Alder also called to offer congratulations. When the team returned home, they were the darlings of the news media. The victory was front-page news in papers all over Hungary, and the team members were on television news and talk shows.

In 2012, Kovacs and Dombovich made their first visit to a North American Championship, held in Atlanta. They were impressed. "The size is enormous," said Dumbovich. And who were their teammates in Atlanta? Members of the American team they had defeated at the world championships!
