On this deal, can you help partner regain the lead?

<Badge type="tip" text="Defense"/>

## The Auction

<table class="hand">
	<tr>
		<td>♠ T982<br>♥ K6<br>♦ JT873<br>♣ AQ</td>
	</tr>
</table>

Suppose you are sitting South. Both sides are vulnerable. East is the dealer and opens 1♦. You have to decide what call to make with the South cards.

With 10 high-card points plus 1 length point for the five-card diamond suit, you might usually consider overcalling. Here, however, East has opened your long suit. So you pass.

West responds 1NT. Your partner, North, passes, and East raises to 2NT, showing an invitational balanced hand with about 18-19 points. The auction is back to you.

Naturally, you pass. No reason to get involved in this auction.

West accepts the invitation, carrying on to 3NT. Partner and East both pass, and you have one more chance to make a call.

There is certainly no reason to say anything. You pass, ending the auction. Partner will be making the opening lead against West's 3NT contract.

## Possible Defense

Partner leads the ♥5 and East puts down the dummy.

The ♥8 is played from dummy, and you have your first decision. What are you playing to this trick?

It looks as though partner has got off to a good lead for your side. The guidance here is third hand high, doing your best to win the trick for your side. You play the ♥K. The ♥K wins the trick as declarer follows with a low heart. Now what?

There is certainly nothing better to do than return partner's suit. You lead your remaining heart, declarer plays the ♥9, and partner wins the trick with the ♥J. Partner continues with the ♥3, and dummy's ♥10 is played. You are at the critical point in the defense. What are you discarding on this trick?

It looks safe to discard a low diamond. You will still be able to stop dummy from getting more than three diamond tricks. Let's see what will happen if you do.

Suppose you discard a low diamond. This time, declarer wins the trick with the ♥A. Declarer has been holding up to make sure you are out of hearts.

Declarer leads a low club. Partner plays a low club, and declarer surprises you a little by playing a low club from dummy. You win the ♣Q. What are you leading to the next trick?

You'd like to get to partner's hand so partner can take the established heart winners. However, nothing looks particularly attractive. The safest thing is to lead a high diamond. At least that won't give away a trick. Suppose you lead the ♦J. Declarer and partner follow with low diamonds, and dummy's ♦Q wins the trick.

Declarer takes a trick with dummy's ♦A. Everyone follows suit. If declarer takes dummy's ♦K, you will have two winners with the ♦10 and ♣A. However, declarer surprises you again by leading a low club. You have no choice but to win the ♣A as declarer and partner follow with low clubs.

You can put declarer back in dummy by leading a diamond. That also establishes your last diamond as a winner. Perhaps declarer can't get off dummy.

Declarer takes a trick with dummy's established ♣K. You discard a spade as declarer follows with a low club and partner with the ♣J.

Declarer has the rest of the tricks at this point. Declarer has an entry with the ♠K and two established club winners to take. Declarer has made the 3NT contract.

Declarer played the contract very well. Declarer couldn't make the contract without establishing at least two club tricks. Since your partner had two heart winners to take on gaining the lead, declarer had to hope you, and not your partner, held the ♣A. In fact, declarer had to hope you held a doubleton ♣A-Q or ♣A-J.

With declarer playing the contract so skillfully, was there anything you could do?

When this actual deal was played, sitting in the South chair was Franck Multon. Let's see how Multon managed to spoil declarer's plan.

## The Actual Defense

Against West's 3NT, Franck Multon's partner led the ♥5. Multon won the first trick with the ♥K as declarer held up winning the ♥A. He returned a heart, and declarer held up again as Multon's partner won the ♥J. Partner then led the ♥3 and the ♥10 was played from dummy.

Partner's original lead of the ♥5 and the play of the ♥3 to this trick indicated partner had started with a five-card heart suit. Declarer was obviously going to win this trick with the ♥A. Partner would have played the ♥A if partner held it. So Multon knew declarer had a heart trick and that partner would have two established heart winners to take if partner could regain the lead.

He could see that declarer had only three diamond winners. Also, West didn't respond 1♠ to the opening 1♦ bid, so West held at most three spades. Even if declarer had the ♠K - which was likely - declarer had only three spade winners. So declarer had only seven winners.

Declarer was going to need to establish two extra winners in the club suit. Multon had two club winners, but how could he get partner back on lead to take the heart winners? Where could partner have a possible entry?

The only hope was in clubs!

If declarer held the ♣J, there was no way declarer could be prevented from establishing the club suit. So Multon had to hope partner held the ♣J. But how could partner gain the lead with the ♣J when Multon held the ♣A-Q?

Partner couldn't, as you've seen. Declarer could arrange to lose any club tricks to Multon rather than Multon's partner.

So Multon found the way to foil declarer's plan.

He discarded the ♣A!

Declarer won the trick with the ♥A.

Let's look at the remaining cards to see why declarer couldn't recover after Multon made this play. These are the remaining cards.

<table class="deal">
	<tr>
		<td></td>
		<td>♠ 753<br>♥ Q7<br>♦ 65<br>♣ J93</td>
		<td></td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>♠ K64<br>♥ <br>♦ 92<br>♣ T8754</td>
		<td><pre>   N<br>W     E<br>   S</pre></td>
		<td>♠ AQJ<br>♥ <br>♦ AKQ4<br>♣ K62</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td></td>
		<td>♠ T982<br>♥ <br>♦ JT873<br>♣ Q</td>
		<td></td>
	</tr>
</table>

As Multon calculated, declarer had won a heart trick and had three spade winners and three diamond winners. Declarer needed to establish two club winners to make the contract. With Multon's discard of the ♣A, dummy's ♣K had become a winner, but declarer still needed one more trick.

Declarer could safely lose one club trick to Multon's ♣Q. However, the club suit still wasn't established. Multon could lead a high diamond, which declarer had to win in dummy. Declarer could take a trick with the ♣K, hoping both defenders would follow suit. But when Multon showed out, declarer knew it was over.

Declarer could take the spade and diamond winners, but that was all. Down one!

## The Rest of the Story

It takes a lot of courage to discard a potential winner. However, Multon worked out that the only way to defeat the contract was to hope partner's clubs were good enough to stop declarer from establishing the suit if Multon discarded one of his club winners. And he was rewarded when partner had exactly what was needed.

Franck Multon was born in 1964 in Nice, France. By age 15, he already preferred playing bridge to going to school. His father, who was also a bridge player, had to go to a different bridge club to avoid playing against his son!

As a Junior, he won the European Championship and was a runner-up in the World Championship. He was a member of the winning team in the 1996 World Olympiad Championship and the 1997 Bermuda Bowl in which France won for the first time. As a bridge professional, he played for several years with Pierre Zimmermann, a Swiss-born real estate developer. Multon and Zimmermann put together teams with other professional pairs and won a couple of world championships. Zimmermann had moved to Monaco and, in 2010, persuaded Multon to become a resident of Monaco along with four other teammates. The team then competed as Team Monaco in European and World Championships, winning and getting silver and bronze medals several times.

Multon's daughter, Laura, became a tournament director at age 20. She is also a good bridge player and sometimes plays with her father.
