## The Auction

<table class="hand">
	<tr>
		<td>♠ AKT83<br>♥ AQ<br>♦ AK2<br>♣ T74</td>
	</tr>
</table>

This deal was played in a team event in North London many years ago. Before we look at what happened at the actual table, let's see how you would bid and play it.

Suppose you are the dealer sitting South. Your side is vulnerable and the opponents are not. You have to choose an opening call in first position.

The hand has 20 high-card points plus 1 length point for the five-card spade suit. Since the hand is balanced, many of today's players would open 2NT, showing 20-21 points. However, at the time this deal was played, it was common to have 2NT show 22-24 points. So let's open 1♠, the bid that was made at the actual table.

West now makes a preemptive jump overcall of 5♣. West presumably has a good eight- or nine-card club suit and little else. Your partner, North, passes, and East also passes. You have to decide what to do after this development.

With half the high-card points in the deck, you don't want West to get away with a non-vulnerable sacrifice at 50 points a trick when your side can make something - likely a game if partner has as few as 5 or 6 points. You can show a strong hand by doubling. This shows enough to defeat 5♣ if partner has nothing to bid. It also shows interest in bidding on if partner has something useful. Let's go with double.

The auction isn't over. West passes, and partner now bids 5♠. East passes, and the auction is back to you.

Partner didn't have enough to bid initially over West's 5♣ but has decided that the partnership has a better chance of making 5♥ than getting a suitable penalty against 5♣ doubled. Since partner may have very little except good distribution to have bid 5♠ and you have already shown a strong hand, there's no reason to go any higher. You pass.

West also passes, having already done a good job of pushing your side higher than you would comfortably like to be. You are now the declarer in 5♠ with West on lead.

## Planning the Play

West leads the ♣A, and partner puts down the dummy.

With six-card spade support and a singleton club, you can see why partner chose to bid on rather than defend. The singleton club and the trump support are nice features in partner's hand, but there isn't any help in either hearts or diamonds.

However, it's time to make a plan, and the first step is to consider the possible losers. There are definitely no spade losers. That's a good start. There is a potential heart loser since you are missing the ♥K. You have three potential club losers since the defenders have all the high clubs. You will be left with a potential diamond loser after the ♦A and ♦K are gone. So there are five potential losers: a heart, three clubs, and a diamond. You need to eliminate three of them.

You have to lose one club trick since West has led the ♣A. There's no problem getting rid of the other two club losers since they can both be ruffed in dummy. So you will need to avoid either a heart loser or a diamond loser.

It doesn't as though you can do anything about the diamond loser, so it seems the best chance for making the contract is the heart finesse. You can lead a heart from dummy and play the ♥Q when East follows with a low heart, hoping East holds the ♥K. That's at least a 50% chance. The odds are slightly better since West presumably holds eight or nine clubs, leaving less room for hearts in West's hand. However, West is the one who ventured to the five level in clubs.

So it appears the success of the contract hinges on the location of the ♥K.

Let's see how the play might go.

## Possible Play

West has led the ♣A. That wins the first trick as the singleton ♣9 is played from dummy, East plays the ♣6, and you follow with the ♣4. West continues with the ♣K. If West started with an eight-card club suit, East has no clubs remaining. You ruff with the ♠7. The only spades that are missing are the ♠6 and ♠5. You are a little surprised to see East follow with the ♣2. West must have started with only a seven-card suit.

No reason to delay drawing the defenders' trumps. East follows to the first round of trumps, but West shows out, discarding a club. The defenders' spades have divided 2-0. You can handle that! You draw East's remaining trump as West discards another club. What next?

Although everything appears to depend on East holding the ♥K, there's no hurry to take the finesse. Perhaps you can put West on lead with the third round of diamonds and force West to lead a heart. That would solve your problem no matter which defender holds the ♥K. If that's your plan, you need to get rid of your last club loser. You don't want West to be able to lead a club if West wins the third round of diamonds.

Suppose you use the opportunity to ruff your last club in dummy. Now you can play the diamonds. You play a diamond to the ♦K. East plays the ♦5 and West the ♦9. You continue with the ♦A as West plays the ♦J and East another low diamond. Now you can put the opponents on lead by playing your last diamond. If West started with ♦Q-J-9 for example, West will win and be endplayed - forced to lead a heart or give you a ruff and a sluff. Unfortunately, West shows out on the third round of diamonds, discarding another club. East wins the trick. So much for that plan. However, you still have the possibility of the ♥K being favorably placed.

East leads the ♥10, and you take a finesse by playing the ♥Q. Sadly, West wins the ♥K. There went your last chance.

You have the rest of the tricks, but the 54 contract is down one. You lost a club, a diamond, and a heart. You were unlucky that West held the ♥K and that you couldn't put West on lead with the third round of diamonds.

Could you have done anything?

On the actual deal, sitting South was Maurice Harrison-Gray, usually known as just "Gray." He was playing with Martin Hoffman in a team event in a bridge club in North London. Gray was also in a 5♠ contract. Let's see how he handled the play.

## The Actual Play

When Maurice Harrison-Gray was playing the contract, the play started off the same way. West won the first trick with the ♣A. West continued with the ♣K, and Gray ruffed carefully with a high trump in dummy. When East followed to this trick with a second club, Gray then knew West had started with only a seven-card club suit and East with a doubleton. West had bid to 5♣ with only seven clubs. West likely had some compensating distribution in the other suits.

Gray drew a round of trumps, on which West showed out. So West had started with a spade void, one of the features that justified West's jump to 5♣. Gray drew East's remaining trump.

Gray had the same idea as discussed earlier. Gray wanted to put West on lead with West's only choice being to lead a heart or give declarer a ruff and a sluff, allowing Gray to ruff in dummy and discard the potential heart loser from his hand. However, he didn't ruff his club loser right away. Instead, he chose to take the diamond winners first. On the ♦A, West followed with the ♦9 and East a low diamond. When he played the ♦K, West followed with the ♦J and East with another low diamond. At this point, Gray took stock. West had shown up with seven clubs, no spades, and two diamonds. Was it likely that West held a third diamond? And, if so, was it likely to be the ♦Q so that East wouldn't win the diamond trick?

Gray decided it was unlikely West held a third diamond. First, West would be less likely to have jumped to 5♣ with three cards in both red suits. West was more likely to have distribution to make 5♣ more attractive. Second, West was a good enough player to see what was happening when Gray played the ♦A-K. West would have played the ♦Q and ♦J under the ♦A-K to avoid being endplayed. Gray concluded that West had only hearts and clubs remaining. It wouldn't do any good to lead a diamond since East would win and be able to lead a heart.

So Gray found a solution. He led his ♣10. West played the ♣J, and...

Gray discarded dummy's diamond!

Instead of losing a diamond trick, he lost a club trick. At the same time, he put West on lead.

Here are the remaining cards.

		<td>♠ AT8<br>♥ AQ<br>♦ 2<br>♣ </td>

	</tr>
</table>

With nothing left to lead but clubs and hearts, West led a heart, hoping East held the ♥Q. However, all East could produce was the ♥8, and Gray won the trick with the ♥Q.

Gray could ruff his remaining diamond in dummy and had the rest of the tricks. He had made the 5♠ contract, losing no heart or diamond tricks but losing two club tricks!

As Gray visualized, West did indeed start with 0=4=2=7 distribution. West would have only gone down two tricks for a penalty of 300 if left to play in 5♣ doubled. Naturally, Gray and Hoffman got a great result for making 5♠.

This deal is a fine example of card play by Gray, but what else is special about this?

Two days earlier, Gray had checked himself out of the hospital, against the doctor's order, so he could play with Hoffman in this event. Gray and Hoffman won the event, but Gray passed away two days later. A bridge player to the end!

Maurice Charles Harrison-Gray was born in 1899 at Ingateson, Essex, England. He served in the British Army in World War I and in the Royal Air Force in World War II. He later became an ardent lepidopterist - breeding tropical moths in his Hampstead home.

In his younger days, he boxed, played rugby and tennis, and rode motorcycles. However, by age 30, he turned to bridge after a series of sports injuries, including a motorcycle accident at 100 mph. Within three years, he was playing for Britain in matches broadcast over the radio against the United States and Australia.

He had initially worked in the family brewing business but then turned to writing, first in fiction and then in bridge. Gray helped in the development of the ACOL bidding system, still used throughout much of England today. He was captain of the winning ACOL team in the years before World War II. After the war, he was on the winning European championship team in 1948, 1949, 1950, and 1963. He led the British contingent in a number of world championships. At one point, however, he took a seven-year hiatus from international bridge while feuding with the British Bridge League.

As one of his teammates wrote: "Like many talented people, Gray was apt to be touchy at even implied criticism of his talent; and disagreements on impersonal issues were apt with him to become personal disputes. These failings perhaps accounted for his long and sterile feud with the British Bridge League."
