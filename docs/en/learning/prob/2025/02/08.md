On this deal, what's the best way to draw the defenders' trumps?

<Badge type="warning" text="Play"/>

## The Auction

<table class="hand">
	<tr>
		<td>♠ 84<br>♥ QJT53<br>♦ 864<br>♣ KJ6</td>
	</tr>
</table>

Suppose you are sitting South on this deal. Both sides are vulnerable. West is the dealer and opens 1♠. Your partner, North, makes a takeout double, and East passes. You have to decide what call to make.

You have 7 high-card points plus 1 length point for the five-card heart suit. Typically, advancer makes a minimum bid with about 0-8 points and an invitational jump with about 9-11 points. So you rebid 2♥.

West passes. Partner now cuebids 2♠, showing a strong hand of about 17 or more points. East passes, and the auction is back to you.

You are at the top of the 0-8 point range for the 2♥ call on the previous round. With a fifth heart and honors in both hearts and clubs, you have enough to jump to 4♥.

Everyone passes, and you are now the declarer in 4♥ with West on lead.

## Planning the Play

West leads the ♠A, and partner puts down the dummy.

<table class="deal">
	<tr>
		<td></td>
		<td>♠ KQ9<br>♥ A98<br>♦ AKQT32<br>♣ 7</td>
		<td></td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>♠ <br>♥ <br>♦ <br>♣ </td>
		<td><pre>   N<br>W     E<br>   S</pre></td>
		<td>♠ <br>♥ <br>♦ <br>♣ </td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td></td>
		<td>♠ 84<br>♥ QJT53<br>♦ 864<br>♣ KJ6</td>
		<td></td>
	</tr>
</table>

Partner does have a good hand - 18 high-card points plus 2 length points for the six-card diamond suit.

The first step in planning the play in a suit contract is to consider the potential losers. There is one potential heart loser since you are missing the ♥K. There is also a sure spade loser which you are going to lose right away since West has led the ♠A. There are no diamond losers since dummy has the top three diamonds. There are three potential club losers since the opponents hold the ♣A, ♣Q and ♣10. So there are five potential losers - a heart, a spade, and three clubs - and you need to eliminate two of them.

You may be able to avoid the heart loser with the help of a finesse if West holds the ♥K, singleton, doubleton, or tripleton. That's usually a 50% chance, but West opened the bidding, increasing the odds that West holds the ♥K.

You might avoid a club loser with the help of a finesse if East holds the ♣A or ♣Q. You could plan to lead the singleton club from dummy and guess whether to play the ♣K or ♣J if East plays a low club. You could also plan to ruff one or two club losers in dummy. To do that, however, you may not be able to trap the ♥K if West holds it. A better idea is to plan on discarding club losers on dummy's extra diamond winners. Dummy will have three extra diamond winners, more than enough, if the four missing diamonds are divided 3-1 or 2-2. You could also discard a club on dummy's extra spade winner.

So there don't appear to be any problems. You can plan to draw the defenders' trumps, even if you lose a trick to the ♥K, and then discard any remaining club losers.

Could anything go wrong?

Let's see how the play might start off.

## Possible Play

West has led the ♠A, which wins the first trick as East plays the ♠J and you play a low spade. West continues with the ♠2. Dummy's ♠Q wins the trick as East follows with the ♠10. What now?

Since you don't have any entries to your hand other than by ruffing dummy's spade winner, it looks best to simply drive out the ♥K. You can afford to lose a heart trick, along with a spade trick and a club trick.

Let's suppose you play the ♥A. Both defenders follow with low hearts. You continue with the ♥9. East plays a low heart and you play a low heart, but West shows out. That's not such good news. The defenders' hearts have divided 4-1 with East holding the ♥K. If you continue with another heart at this point, East can win and lead a club. If West holds the ♣A-Q, you will lose two club tricks and go down. What else can you do?

Suppose you play dummy's spade winner. East discards a diamond, and you can discard a club. You take one of dummy's high diamonds as both defenders follow suit, East with the ♦J. When you lead another diamond, East ruffs with a low heart.

East plays the ♥K, removing dummy's last trump. East then leads a club. You try the ♣J, but West wins the ♣Q.

West takes a trick with the ♣A and that's the fifth trick for the defense. You have the rest of the tricks, but 4♥ is down two. The 4-1 heart break really gave you a problem.

This was an actual deal from the final of the 1984 Gold Cup, Great Britain's premier team knockout event. Sitting South was Nicola Smith, playing with Sally Brock. They, too, arrived at a 4♥ contract, but with a slightly different auction. After Brock's takeout double, Smith made an aggressive invitational response with 3♥. Brock then raised to 4♥. Let's see how Smith handled the play.

## The Actual Play

Against Nicola Smith, the defense started the same way. West won the first trick with the ♠A. West continued with another spade, and dummy's ♠Q won the second trick.

Nicola wanted to draw the defenders' trumps and then take the diamond winners. However, she was worried that she would run into difficulties if the trumps broke 4-1. How could she guard against that?

She led a low heart from dummy!

She wanted to draw the defenders' trumps but maintain control of the suit in case they broke badly.

East won the ♥K. East shifted to a club. Smith tried the ♣J, but West won the ♣Q. She had lost three tricks, but what could West do?

West continued with the ♣A. Smith ruffed with dummy's ♥A. She drew one of East's trumps as West showed out. She drew another of East's trumps with a high heart. She then drew East's last trump with another high heart.

She had the rest of the tricks with nothing but winners left. She had made the 4♥ contract, losing only a spade, a heart, and one club trick.

## The Rest of the Story

Nicola Smith's play of a low heart at trick two left her in control of the deal no matter which defender held the ♥K. It also guarded against a 4-1 break.

At the other table in the team game, declarer started by playing the ♥A and another heart, and lost control of the trump suit. Nicola's team went on to win the Gold Cup.
