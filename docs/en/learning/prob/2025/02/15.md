On this deal, there is an unfavorable lie of the cards. Is there still a chance to make the contract?

## The Auction

<table class="hand">
	<tr>
		<td>♠ AQJT862<br>♥ A5<br>♦ Q86<br>♣ 7</td>
	</tr>
</table>

Suppose you are sitting South on this deal. The opponents are vulnerable and your side is not. West is the dealer and passes. Your partner, North, passes and so does East. You have to decide what to do in fourth position.

With 13 high-card points plus 3 length points for the seven-card spade suit, your hand is too strong to make a preemptive opening - although some might open 4♠, expecting partner to have a share of the missing points since no one opened the bidding in the first three positions. However, with a sound one-level opening bid, let's go with opening 1♠.

West passes, and partner responds 2♠. Since partner is a passed hand, the popular style is that this is the Drury convention, showing three-card or longer support for spades and an invitational hand of about 10-12 points. Let's assume that's the partnership agreement. Even if the 2♣ bid was natural, it would still show invitational values. East passes, and you have to decide what to do next.

With partner showing an invitational hand with three or more spades, you have enough to accept the invitation and jump right to 4♠. Even if partner were only showing about 10 or more points and a club suit, your spades are good enough to bid game in spades. So let's go with a jump to 4♠.

Everyone passes, and you are now the declarer in 4♠ with West on lead.

## Planning the Play

West leads the ♦A, and partner puts down the dummy.

Partner has 11 high-card points and three-card spade support.

In 4♠, you start by considering the potential losers. There is no spade loser. You have all the top cards. There are also no heart losers since dummy's ♥K will take care of the low heart in your hand. There is a potential club loser. Even though dummy has the ♣K-Q, the opponents have the ♣A. Unless you can turn the ♦Q into a winner, there are three potential diamond losers since the opponents have all the top diamonds other than the ♦Q. Since West has led the ♦A, it looks as though you are going to lose at least one of the diamonds right away. So there are four potential losers, a club and three diamonds. You need to eliminate one loser.

It doesn't look as though you can do anything about the club loser unless West has the ♣A and doesn't take it when you lead a club toward dummy. If West does have the ♣A and takes it, however, you will have two club winners in dummy on which to potentially discard diamond losers. Even if East has the ♣A, you can promote one extra club winner in dummy on which you might be able to discard a diamond loser.

You can't do anything about the diamond losers in the diamond suit itself. However, West has led the ♦A, likely from a holding headed by the ♦A-K. If West continues with the ♦K, that will establish your ♦Q as a winner. That's as long as East didn't start with a doubleton diamond and can get a ruff.

So, it appears you either have to hope West continues with a diamond and establishes your ♦Q as a winner or you have to establish a club winner on which to discard a diamond before the defenders can take three diamond tricks.

Let's see how the play might start off.

## Possible Play

West has led the ♦A. You play a low diamond from dummy, East makes a discouraging signal with the ♦2, and you follow with a low diamond. West has won the first trick. You are hoping West will continue with the ♦K, establishing your ♦Q as a winner. However, West has seen East's discouraging attitude signal of the ♦2 on the first trick. West switches to the ♥Q. You are at the critical point in the play. What are you playing to this trick?

It doesn't look as though it matters where you win this trick. So let's assume you play a low heart from dummy, East plays the ♥7, and you win the trick with the ♥A. There doesn't seem to be any reason to delay drawing the defenders' trumps. Suppose you play the ♠A. Both defenders follow with low spades. You continue with the ♠Q, drawing the defenders' last trump. West discards a low heart, and East follows with the defenders' last spade.

It looks like it's time to lead a club. If West has the ♣A, the contract is secure. If West doesn't take the ♣A, you won't lose a club trick. If West does take the ♣A, West can take a diamond trick but that's all. You lead a club. West plays low, and you play dummy's ♣Q. Unfortunately, East wins the trick with the ♣A.

Dummy's ♣K is established as a winner, but it's not going to help. East leads the ♦10 and your ♦Q is trapped. You try the ♦Q, but West wins the trick with the ♦K.

West takes a trick with the ♦J. That's the fourth trick for the defense. You have the rest of the tricks, but 4♠ is down one. You lost a club and three diamond tricks. With both the diamonds and the clubs lying unfavorably, it doesn't appear there was anything you could do.

When this actual deal was played during the 1975 Italian Open Teams, sitting South was Benito Garozzo, one of the stars of the famous Italian Blue Team. His partner was another of the stars on the team, Giorgio Belladonna. Let's see how Garozzo managed to make the contract.

## The Actual Play

Against Garozzo, West started with the ♦A, presumably from a holding headed by the ♦A-K. This won the first trick as East gave a discouraging attitude signal with the ♦2. West switched to the ♥Q.

Garozzo knew the contract was secure if West held the ♣A. He would be able to establish club winners in dummy on which to discard one or more of the diamond losers. But could West hold the ♣A?

No!

West passed as dealer and passed throughout the auction. From the opening lead, West must have the ♦A-K. East would have made an encouraging attitude signal if holding the ♦K. In addition, West appears to have the ♥Q-J. West has already shown up with at least 10 high-card points. If West also held the West would have opened the bidding. So Garozzo concluded East must hold the ♣A. If East holds the ♣A, the contract has no legitimate chance. When East wins a trick with the ♣A, East will lead back a diamond, trapping Garozzo's ♦Q, and the defenders would have four tricks—three diamonds and a club.

So Garozzo decided a ruse was necessary.

He played a low heart from dummy and, when East followed with the ♥7, he played a low heart from his hand, letting West win the trick!

If West realized what was going on, West could defeat the contract two tricks. West could lead a club to East's ♣A and East could lead back a diamond, giving the defenders the first five tricks. When the ♥Q won, however, West naturally assumed East must hold the ♥A. West continued with another heart, and Garozzo won this trick with the ♥A.

He drew a round of trumps with the ♠A. He continued with a low spade to dummy's ♠9, drawing the defenders' remaining trump. He then played the ♥K and discarded the singleton club. Next, he led the ♣K from dummy, "knowing" East had the ♣A. If East had played a low club, he would have discarded one of his diamond losers. However, East played the ♣A and Garozzo ruffed. He crossed back to dummy with the ♣K. On the established ♣Q, he discarded one of his diamond losers.

He still had a diamond loser, but that was all. He had the last three tricks with the three remaining trumps. He made the 4♠ contract, losing a heart(!) and two diamond tricks... but no club trick.

Once Garozzo determined that East must hold the ♣A, he knew there was no legitimate chance to make the contract. However, he figured out how to keep the dangerous opponent, East, from gaining the lead with the ♣A. He had to risk going down an extra trick by losing a trick he didn't have to lose, but the deception worked. Garozzo had to work all this out very quickly so he could duck West's ♥Q in both hands smoothly.

This was one of Garozzo's favorite deals. In 1997, Jeff Meckstroth found a similar play and won the Best Played Hand of the Year award. For Garozzo, it was just another well-played hand.

Benito Garozzo is considered by many to be the best bridge player of all time. He was a member of the famous Italian Blue Team - Squadra Azzura - in the 1960s and 1970s that won 10 Bermuda Bowl championships between 1961 and 1975. In all, he has won thirteen world championships.

Born in Naples, Italy, Garozzo spent much of his youth living in Cairo, Egypt. While visiting his sister in Naples in 1943, he became stranded in the city due to the events of World War II. That was when he spent time learning to play bridge using a 1933 Ely Culbertson book, which was an inauspicious start since neither he nor his friends spoke or read English. After the war ended, he began studying bridge seriously.

In 1961, he was invited to join the Italian Blue Team, just 10 days before the Bermuda Bowl. Up until then, he had enjoyed success playing very few conventions, but that was not the Blue Team way. He had to learn the Neopolitan Club system as quickly as possible. The result... his first world championship.

Garozzo's card play grew legendary in this era. When discussing a difficult deal, his teammates would sometimes say, "This problem is too difficult, we are going to have to ask Benito."
