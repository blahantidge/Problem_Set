## The Auction

<table class="hand">
	<tr>
		<td>♠ AQ8642<br>♥ AJT<br>♦ K8<br>♣ A9</td>
	</tr>
</table>

Suppose you are sitting South on this deal. Your side is vulnerable and the opponents are not. East is the dealer and passes. You have to choose an opening call with this hand.

There are 18 high-card points plus 2 length points for the six-card spade suit. That's not strong enough to start with a strong artificial 2♣ opening, so you simply start with 1♠.

West passes. Partner, North, responds 2♣. East passes, and the auction is back to you.

Your choice of rebid depends on the partnership methods, so lees assume you have agreed to play that a two-over-one response is forcing to game. If the partnership is playing two-over-one game forcing, then there is no need to jump at this point to show extra values. You can simply rebid the spades to show a six-card or longer suit. If you are using standard methods, however, a 2♠ rebid would not be forcing. You would then have to jump to 3♣ or choose some other forcing bid. Lees go with a forcing rebid of 2♠.

West passes, and partner jumps to 4♠. This shows support for spades but not much extra for the two-over-one response. East passes, and you have another chance to make a call.

Since you have a spade fit and partner has shown game-forcing values with a response at the two level, slam is likely, perhaps even a grand slam. To make sure you aren't missing any aces, you can use the Blackwood convention, 4NT.

West passes, and partner replies 5♦, showing one ace playing standard methods. If the partnership uses keycard Blackwood, partner makes the reply to show one keycard. East passes, and the auction is back to you.

Playing standard Blackwood, you now know the partnership has all the aces and a grand slam is still possible if partner has enough kings. In standard methods, you can ask about kings by continuing the Blackwood convention and bidding 5NT. Let's go with that. If the partnership is using keycard Blackwood, however, partner's response would tell you the partnership is missing a keycard. You can then simply sign off in 6♠ at this point.

West passes, and partner replies 6♦, showing one king. East passes. What now?

Missing two kings, you don't want to be in a grand slam. You can settle for a small slam in spades.

Everyone passes, and you are now the declarer in 6♠ with West on lead.

## Planning the Play

West leads the ♥K, and partner puts down the dummy.

	</tr>
</table>

You have to find a way to take twelve tricks.

Partner has only 12 high-card points but also a couple of 10s, and the contract is a good one.

The first step in planning the play in a suit contract is to consider the potential losers in 6♠. There is one potential spade loser since you are missing the ♠K. You start with two potential heart losers. However, West has led the ♥K. After winning the ♥A, you will be left with one heart loser, the ♥Q. There are no club or diamond losers. You even have extra winners in both suits. So there are only two potential losers, a spade and a heart. You'll have to eliminate one of them.

In spades, you can avoid a loser with the help of a finesse if East holds the ♠K. That's a 50% chance.

In hearts, you can discard one heart on the extra winner in clubs and a second heart on the extra winner in diamonds. So that looks straightforward enough. Is there any problem?

Things would be easy if West had not led a heart. You could take the spade finesse and, whether it wins or loses, you can then draw the defenders' trumps. After the trumps are gone, you could safely discard two hearts on dummy's extra winners. West's heart lead, however, presents you with a problem. If you try the spade finesse and it loses, the defenders can immediately take a trick with the ♥Q before you can discard both your remaining hearts. If you don't draw the defenders' trumps first, however, there is the danger that a defender could ruff one of your winners. Should you try the spade finesse first? Or should you try to discard your heart losers before tackling the trumps?

Let's see how the play might start off.

## Possible Play

West has led the ♥K, and you win the first trick with the ♥A. You are at the critical point in the play. You have to decide whether to play spades first or try to discard the hearts first.

The spade finesse is a straight 50% chance. The odds of the seven missing clubs dividing 4-3 are 62% and the odds of the eight missing diamonds dividing no worse than 5-3 are 80%. Since you need both things to happen, the combined odds are about 50%. So it looks like a toss-up.

Let's suppose you decide to try getting rid of the heart losers first. If that works, you can try the spade finesse for an overtrick. You take a trick with the ♣A. Both defenders follow suit. You continue with a club to dummy's ♣Q. Both defenders follow again. So far so good. You lead dummy's ♣K. East follows suit. You discard one of your hearts... Oops! West ruffs with the ♠9. The defenders' clubs have divided 5-2.

West takes a trick with the ♥Q. That's down one. West leads a diamond, and you win in dummy.

You might as well try the spade finesse now to try to avoid going down another trick. You lead the ♠J. East plays low, you play low, and... the finesse loses to West's ♠K. It's not your day!

The contract is now down two. You couldn't get rid of your heart losers in time because the clubs broke badly. But it wouldn't have helped to try the spade finesse first so that you could draw trumps. Is there a chance 6♠ could make?

This was an actual deal in the 1984 World Bridge Championships final 96-board match between Poland and France. Tomasz Przybora, representing Poland, was sitting South. Using a different auction, he and his partner also arrived at a 6♠ contract. Let's see how he played the hand.

## The Actual Play

West led the ♥K. Przybora won the first trick with the ♥A.

Since it was more likely that three rounds of diamonds could be played without being ruffed, he started with the ♦K. Both defenders followed suit. He played a diamond to dummy's •Q, and both defenders followed a second time. He led the ♦A. If East had ruffed this trick, he could overruff and then fall back on the spade finesse. However, East followed suit and Przybora discarded one of his hearts. West also followed suit, so he passed the first hurdle.

Przybora then made a key play. He played a spade to the ♠A!

He didn't try the spade finesse. That gave him the additional chance that the ♠K would fall. The ♠K didn't appear, but there were only two spades outstanding, the ♠K and a low spade. Next, he went after the clubs. He took a trick with the ♣A. Both defenders followed suit. He continued with a low club to dummy's ♣Q. Again, both defenders followed suit. He then played the discarding his last heart when East followed with a low club. The bad news was that West ruffed this trick. The good news was it was with the ♠K!

The rest was easy. West led the ♥Q, but it was too late. Przybora could ruff this trick. He drew East's remaining trump.

He had the rest of the tricks, making the 6♠ slam contract. He had lost a trick to the ♠K, but that was all.

## The Rest of the Story

At the other table, the French declarer had played as discussed earlier and went down two tricks. By making the slam, Przybora gained 17 IMPs for the Polish team which went on to defeat France and win the world championship.

Przybora's line of play was much better than that of the French declarer. First, he gave himself the extra chance that either defender held a singleton ♠K. Second, he gave himself the chance that, if a defender had started with a doubleton ♠K - as on the actual deal - he would still make the contract. He would only go down if a defender had only two clubs and started with two low spades.
