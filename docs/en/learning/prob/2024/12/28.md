On this deal, what's the best way to get rid of your extra losers?

## The Auction

<table class="hand">
	<tr>
		<td>♠ Q954<br>♥ A7<br>♦ KQ6<br>♣ 7543</td>
	</tr>
</table>

Let's suppose you are sitting South on this deal with both sides vulnerable. West is the dealer and passes. Your partner, North, opens the bidding 1♦, and East passes. You have to choose what to respond.

With 11 high-card points, you have more than enough to respond at the one level. You start by bidding the four-card major suit.

West passes, partner raises to 2♠, and East passes. The auction is back to you.

Although partner is showing a minimum opening bid of about 12-16 points, with 11 points, you have enough to make a game invitation. Classically, the straightforward way to invite game was to re-raise to 3♠. However, that has fallen out of favor, especially since partner might have raised with only three-card support. Most of today's partnerships would treat 3♠ as a blocking action, designed to make it more challenging for the opponents to take any sort of balancing action. The modern style is to make some form of game try, describing something more about responder's hand to help opener decide whether to accept. Your hand is balanced, with only four spades, a heart stopper, and length in clubs to help serve as a stopper. So the most descriptive game try is 2NT, although some might make a help suit game try of 3♣. Let's go with 2NT.

West passes, and partner jumps to 4♠. East passes, and you have to decide what to do next.

Partner has accepted the game try, so you have nothing more to say.

West passes, and you are now the declarer in 4♠ with West on lead.

## Planning the Play

West leads the ♦2, and partner puts down the dummy.

<table class="deal">

		<td></td>
		<td>♠ KJT8<br>♥ K986<br>♦ AJ3<br>♣ JT</td>
		<td></td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>♠ <br>♥ <br>♦ <br>♣ </td>
		<td><pre>   N<br>W     E<br>   S</pre></td>
		<td>♠ <br>♥ <br>♦ <br>♣ </td>

	</tr>
</table>

Partner has only 13 high-card points plus 1 dummy point for the doubleton club, but partner does have four-card spade support.

The focus is now on taking ten tricks, starting with considering the potential losers. There is a sure spade loser, the ♠A. Unless the defenders' spades are divided 5-0, that should be all. There are no heart losers. Dummy's ♥K will take care of the low heart in your hand. There are four potential club losers since the opponents hold the ♣A-K-Q-9. There are no diamond losers. So you have five potential losers: a spade and four clubs. You need to eliminate two of them.

You can't do anything about the spade loser or two of the club losers, so it looks as though you need to get rid of the other two club losers. You could plan to ruff the losers in dummy after giving up two club tricks. Will that work?

Let's see.

## Possible Play

West has led the ♦2. Let's suppose you choose to win this trick in your hand. You can't afford to start drawing the defenders' trumps since you need two trumps in dummy to ruff two club losers. Let's suppose you give up a club trick. East wins the ♣Q.

Seeing what you are planning to do, East leads back a trump, removing one of dummy's trumps. You give up another club trick and East wins with the ♣K. East now leads the ♠A, removing another of dummy's trumps. East continues with a third round of spades, removing a third trump from dummy. You win the trick in your hand.

You can lead one of your remaining club losers and ruff in dummy. However, you still have a club loser left in your hand.

You get back to your hand with the ♥A. You draw the defenders' last trump. But you will still have to lose a club or a heart. Down one.

So trying to ruff two club losers in dummy won't work. The defenders can lead trumps each time you give up a club and, since they have the ♠A, you will lose the race.

Let's go back to planning the play again.

## Another Possible Play

Since you can't make the contract by trying to ruff two clubs in dummy, what's the alternative?

Sometimes, it is helpful to look at things from dummy's perspective, as if dummy were declaring the contract.

Dummy has no diamond losers but still has the same sure spade loser and two club losers. However, instead of having two additional club losers to eliminate, dummy has two heart losers. So what about planning to ruff both of dummy's heart losers with declarer's trumps?

This appears to be a better plan. The advantage of this plan is that you don't have to give up the lead twice to the opponents in order to ruff the hearts.

So let's see whether this works on this deal. West leads the ♦2 and you win the first trick. You can immediately go to work on the heart suit. You take a trick with the ♥A. You continue with a heart to dummy's ♥K. You now lead one of dummy's heart losers and ruff in your hand. You can even afford to ruff with a high spade in case West is out of hearts. West would have to overruff with the which would be okay since you have to lose that trick anyway. West, however, follows suit. The defenders' hearts have divided 4-3.

You need to get back to dummy to ruff another heart. You can afford to do that by leading a trump. Even if the opponents win the ♠A and lead another spade, you will still have a spade left in your hand to ruff dummy's last heart. When you lead a spade to dummy's ♠8, however, the opponents choose not to take their ♠A. Now that you are back in dummy, you can lead the last heart loser. When East shows out, discarding a diamond, you could ruff with your low spade because West must have the last heart. However, you can afford to ruff with a high spade - just in case you miscounted.

Having eliminated dummy's heart losers, all you need to do is drive out the ♠A, draw the remaining trump, and take the diamond winners. When you lead a spade, however, West shows out. The defenders' spades have divided 4-1. This time, East wins the ♠A.

East takes one of the defenders' club winners. East continues with another club which West wins. West continues with yet another club. That's not good news. You've already lost three tricks, so you have to ruff with one of dummy's spades. You draw one of East's remaining trumps. You take one of your diamond winners.

When you lead your diamond winner, however, East is able to ruff with the last trump. 4♠ is down one. You lost two clubs and two spade tricks. Everything would have been okay if the defenders' trumps had divided 3-2 instead of 4-1.

Despite the unlucky break, could you have made the contract?

This was an actual deal that was played in the final of the 2010 Gold Cup, Britain's premier team event and one of the oldest tournaments anywhere. Sitting South was Gunnar Hallberg, playing with Zia Mahmood. They, too, arrived at a 4♠ contract. Let's see how Hallberg handled the play. He also recognized that it was necessary to ruff dummy's heart losers rather than the club losers. So he played along the same lines as we've just seen. At trick two, he took a trick with the ♥A.

## The Actual Play

Gunnar Hallberg got the same lead of the ♦2 and won the trick with the ♦Q. He also recognized that it was necessary to ruff dummy's heart losers rather than the club losers. So he played along the same lines as we've just seen. At trick two, he took a trick with the ♥A. He played another heart to dummy's ♥K. He then ruffed a heart with the ♠9 in his hand. Next, he led a trump toward dummy's ♠8 which won the trick. The opponents did not take the ♠A.

Before ruffing dummy's last heart, however, he made a key play. Since three rounds of hearts had been played and both opponents followed suit each time, he knew the hearts were divided 4-3. One of the defenders was out of hearts.

So he took his diamond winners!

He didn't want to give a defender the opportunity to discard a diamond when the fourth round of hearts was led. He played a diamond to his hand. He led a diamond back to dummy's ♦A. When both defenders followed, the contract was secure. He could safely lead dummy's last heart loser and ruff with the ♠Q. He had taken the first eight tricks and was assured of two more with dummy's remaining spades. He led a spade, driving out East's ♠A.

East took the defenders' two club winners. But Hallberg had the last two tricks with dummy's high trumps. He had made the 4♠ contract, losing only two clubs and one spade trick, despite the 4-1 spade break.

The technique Gunnar Hallberg used to make the contract is a dummy reversal. Instead of ruffing declarer's losers in dummy, dummy's losers are ruffed in declarer's hand and dummy's trumps are used to draw the defenders' trumps.

As Zia Mahmood said when he wrote up this deal for The Guardian, Hallberg's play was "an example of good technique rewarded." The key play was to take the diamond winners before ruffing the fourth round of hearts. As Zia said, "It's an old theme: if you're going to play on crossruff lines, cash your side-suit winners early."

Hallberg and Zia's team went on to win the Gold Cup.

Gunnar Hallberg started his bridge life in Sweden and was a regular on the Swedish national team in the 1980s. He was a six-time Swedish team champion, Nordic champion, and European silver medalist. He moved to England to play bridge professionally in 1995 and is a frequent winner in London's rubber bridge clubs.

He reached the semifinals of the 2000 World Olympiad playing for Great Britain, and won the Cavendish teams, the Australian Championships, and North America's prestigious Vanderbilt trophy - becoming the first Brit ever to do so.

In writing about his daily life, Hallberg says, "I play whenever and wherever my sponsors want me to, and enjoy the rest of my life, and especially with my daughter, as much as I can in between." "I like it this way, and my family in Sweden, old Vikings that they are, are now quite proud of the wayward youngster who left a traditional way of life and his country to become a bridge professional."

Hallberg offers this advice if you want to do well in serious competitions. "If you are in harmony with yourself, it will be easier to be in harmony with your partner, and you will both be able to play to the best of your ability." "Nothing spoils potentially good partnerships as much as one of the two being unhappy with themselves and taking it out on partner."
