On this deal, can you find the winning play?

## The Auction

<table class="hand">
	<tr>
		<td>♠ AQJ952<br>♥ 2<br>♦ AJ962<br>♣ 2</td>
	</tr>
</table>

On this deal, you are sitting South. The opponents are vulnerable and your side is not. East is the dealer and passes. You have to decide what call to make in second position.

You have only 12 high-card points. However, you can add 2 length points for a six-card spade suit and 1 for the five-card diamond suit. That's more than enough to open at the one level in the six-card major suit.

West passes, and partner, North, responds with 2♥. East passes, and the auction is back to you.

The choice of rebids depends somewhat on the partnership methods you are using. With a distributional hand, let's go with showing the second suit, even though it has to be bid at the three level. Rebidding spades would show only the sixth spade. Showing the diamonds shows at least five spades and four diamonds.

West passes, partner bids 3♠, and East passes. The partnership is committed to game and you have found a spade fit. You must decide what to do next.

You could rebid diamonds to show the fifth card but, having already found a fit, the only question is whether you belong in game or slam. You aren't quite strong enough to take charge and bid Blackwood, but you can show slam interest by making a control-showing bid of 4♣. That shows the ♣A or ♣K, or a singleton or void. Let's go with that.

West passes, and partner takes charge by bidding 4NT, the Blackwood convention. East passes, and the auction is back to you.

Playing standard Blackwood, you would reply 5♥, showing two aces. If the partnership uses keycard Blackwood, you would reply 5♠ to show two key cards plus the ♠Q.

West passes, and partner bids 6♠. East passes, and you have another chance to make a call.

Partner has taken charge and set the contract, so you have nothing more to say.

West also passes, ending the auction. You are now the declarer in 6♠ and have to find a way to take twelve tricks.

## Planning the Play

West leads the ♦3, and partner puts down the dummy.

In planning the play in a suit contract, you start by considering the number of potential losers you have. You have the four top spades, so you don't appear to have any spade losers. Partner's ♥A will take care of the singleton heart in your hand, so you don't have any heart losers. You are missing the ♣A-K, but you have only a singleton club in your hand. So there is only one club loser. Partner's ♦K will take care of one of the diamonds in your hand. However, you are still left with three potential diamond losers. That's a total of four potential losers. You'll have to eliminate three of them.

Since the opponents haven't led a club, you could possibly get rid of the club loser by taking a heart finesse, hoping West holds the ♥K. You could then discard your club on dummy's ♥A. That's a 50% chance.

In diamonds, you can plan to ruff one or more diamond losers in dummy. If the ♦Q falls on the third round of diamonds, you need only ruff one diamond in dummy. If a defender started with four diamonds including the ♦Q, you will need to ruff twice in dummy before your last diamond becomes a winner through length. If a defender holds five diamonds, you would need to ruff three times in dummy... which might be possible.

Taking an immediate heart finesse is not the best idea. If it loses, you will be down right away. East will surely switch to clubs. Even if it wins, you will still have to do something about the diamond losers.

A better plan is to ruff one or more diamonds in dummy, planning to establish the suit. You can then draw the defenders' trumps and finish with only a club loser.

Are there any potential problems with that plan?

Since you can't first draw the defenders' trumps because you need dummy's spades to ruff diamonds, you will need to be careful to avoid getting overruffed, both when you ruff in dummy and when you have to get back to your hand with a ruff. You may need to ruff one of the diamonds with dummy's ♠K to avoid being overruffed.

Let's see how the play might go.

## Possible Play

West has led the ♦3, and you win the first trick with dummy's ♦K as East follows with a low diamond.

You need to get to your hand so you can ruff one or more diamonds in dummy. Let's suppose you decide to do that by ruffing hearts to get to your hand. You can't afford to cross to your hand right away with a spade since you don't know how many times you may need to ruff in dummy. So you play dummy's ♥A, and both defenders follow suit. Both defenders also follow with low hearts when you ruff a heart next. It's best to ruff with a low spade now while the opponents are still likely to both have hearts.

Since you want to know how many diamonds you need to ruff in dummy, let's suppose you next take a trick with the ♦A. Both defenders follow suit, but no ♦Q appears. You lead a diamond and, when West follows with a low diamond, you ruff with a low spade in dummy. You are hoping East didn't start with a doubleton diamond. East follows suit, but the ♦Q still hasn't appeared.

You will need to leave the ♠K in dummy since whichever defender doesn't hold the ♦Q will be out of diamonds and able to overruff if dummy has only a low spade remaining. However, you can afford to cross back to your hand with a spade, avoiding the possibility of getting overruffed if you lead a heart. When you lead a low spade to the West shows out. That's not good. The missing spades have divided 4-0.

You still need to establish your diamonds. You lead a diamond, and West shows up with the ♦Q. You can ruff high in dummy with the ♠K as East discards a club. Your remaining diamond is now a winner.

You can safely ruff a heart to get back to your hand once more as East discards another club.

Your last diamond has been established as a winner, but you are going to have to lose a club and a trick to East's ♠10. 6♠ is down one. You were unlucky that you had to ruff diamonds twice in dummy and that the spades broke 4-0.

This was an actual deal from the finals of the 2001 Bermuda Bowl championship. Lew Stansby and Chip Martel of the United States were in the North-South positions. Their opponents were the Norwegian pair of Boye Brogeland and Erik Saelensminde. Martel and Stansby's auction went a little differently, but they landed in the same 6♠ contract with Martel as declarer. Let's see how he handled the play as declarer.

## The Actual Play

Saelensminde led a diamond, and Martel won the first trick with dummy's ♦K.

Martel decided the best approach was to try to establish the diamond suit by ruffing diamonds in dummy. However, he first wanted to establish a way to reach his hand other than by ruffing hearts - and potentially being overruffed.

He led the ♣Q from dummy, giving up a club trick.

East won the trick with the ♣A. Seeing that declarer was planning to ruff diamonds in dummy, East switched to the ♠8. That presented Martel with a challenge. If he won this trick in dummy with the ♠K, he wouldn't be able to ruff two diamonds in dummy without being overruffed. Had he been able to see all the hands, he could have played the ♠9 to this trick, but that risked West holding the ♠10. So, Martel naturally won the trick with the ♠J. Unfortunately, West showed out on this trick. East had started with four spades, including the ♠10.

He would still be okay if he only had to ruff one diamond in dummy. He took a trick with the ♦A, and both defenders followed with low diamonds. He led a diamond and ruffed with dummy's low spade. Both defenders followed, but no ♦Q appeared. He was going to have to ruff a diamond with the ♠K. But what could he do about the potential spade loser?

He ruffed a club to get back to his hand. Martel could see he wasn't going to be able to make the contract if he ruffed a diamond at this point. He could establish his last diamond as a winner but would still have to lose a spade trick. So he found a solution.

He decided he needed the heart finesse.

He led his singleton heart and, when West followed with a low heart, he played dummy's ♥Q. The finesse won, and that was what he needed to see. But he still needed a bit more luck. On the ♥A, he discarded a diamond. When East followed with a second heart, Martel was in command.

He ruffed a club to get back to his hand again. Next, he ruffed the ♦J with the ♠K.

Here are the remaining cards.

	</tr>

		<td>♠ AQ9<br>♥ <br>♦ J<br>♣ </td>

	</tr>
</table>

East couldn't overruff that and had to discard a club. East was down to three spades, including the ♠10. Since the lead was still in dummy, Martel was able to lead another club. What could East do?

East ruffed with a low spade, but Martel overruffed.

Martel had the last two tricks with the ♠A and ♠Q. He had made the 6♠ contract, losing only a club trick.

The technique Chip Martel used to recover when the defenders' trumps divided 4-0 was a trump coup. He had to shorten his trump holding to the same length as East and also arrange to be leading from dummy at the appropriate time.

At the other table, the Norwegian North-South pair reached the same contract but, after a club lead, declarer didn't find the winning line of play. The U.S. team went on to win the final and take home the Bermuda Bowl.

Chip Martel began playing bridge in high school and continued playing while getting his Bachelor of Science degree from MIT and Ph.D. from Berkeley. It was at Berkeley that he met his wife, Jan, and long-time partner, Lew Stansby.

He won his first North American title in 1981, playing with Stansby. The following year, they won their first world title, the Open Pairs. Martel and Stansby would go on to win four additional world championships and more than 20 North American titles.

Martel has also won titles playing with his wife, Jan, as well as Zia Mahmood, Kit Woolsey, and Eric Rodwell. In 2014, he was inducted into the Bridge Hall of Fame.

Martel was a professor of computer science at the University of California until his retirement in 2013. He helped found the computer science department there and served as the department chair. In the 1985-1986 academic year, he achieved the rare double of winning a world championship and also achieving tenure.
