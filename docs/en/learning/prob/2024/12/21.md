On this deal, can the opponents' bidding help you make the contract?

## The Auction

<table class="hand">
	<tr>
		<td>♠ AKJ7652<br>♥ K3<br>♦ A<br>♣ AK2</td>
	</tr>
</table>

On this deal, sitting South was Philadelphia star, Charles Solomon. North and South were vulnerable and West was the dealer. West opened the bidding with a preemptive 3♣ bid, North overcalled 3♦, and East bid 3♠. Solomon had to decide what to do after this start.

Solomon had a surprisingly good hand with all three players bidding in front of him. Partner's vulnerable 3♦ overcall showed a pretty good hand, so it was likely the opponents were taking advantage of their favorable vulnerability to make things difficult for North-South. With a void in diamonds, Solomon could make a penalty double of 3♠. However, it was quite possible North-South had a slam in hearts. Solomon could have bid only 4♥. With a solid heart suit, however, he chose to invite slam by jumping to 5♥. This can have various meanings in experienced partnerships, but let's go along with jumping to 5♥.

West passed, and North bid 6♦. East passed, and Solomon had to decide what to do after this development.

It sounded as though partner had a pretty good diamond suit, and perhaps Solomon should simply pass and hope for the best. However, Solomon's hearts were solid enough to be the trump suit even if partner had a singleton or void. So Solomon elected to "correct" to 6♥. Let's go with that.

Everyone passed, and Solomon was the declarer in 6♥.

Before we see how Solomon played the deal, let's suppose you are the declarer in the South position. How would you handle the 6♥ contract?

The first step in planning the play in a suit contract, even in a slam, is to consider the potential losers. The good news is there are unlikely to be any losers in the trump suit, even though dummy has only a singleton. There would only be a loser if the missing hearts were divided 6-0. The spade suit is not nearly as good. Once dummy's ♠A is gone, you will be left with three potential losers in your hand. There are no diamond losers. In fact, dummy has two winners on which you could discard losers in other suits. You do, however, have a sure club loser since you are missing the ♣A. So there are four potential losers - three spades and a club. You need to eliminate three of them.

You can discard two of the spade losers on dummy's ♦A-K, but that still leaves you with a spade and a club loser.

Is there anything you can do to get rid of the third spade loser?

If the six missing diamonds in the defenders' hands are divided exactly 3-3, then you could establish dummy's remaining diamonds as winners by ruffing a diamond. Even if that works, however, there is another problem. You don't have a sure entry to reach dummy once the ♠A is gone. Since West opened the bidding 3♣, West almost certainly has the ♣A. Perhaps you can sneak an entry to dummy by leading a low club to dummy's ♣J.

Let's see if that will work.

## Possible Play

West has led the ♠9. You have your first decision. Should you win this trick with dummy's ♠A?

Certainly!

Since East bid 3♠ during the auction, East must hold the other spades. West's spade must be a singleton. If you let East win, East can give West a spade ruff. Also, if you lose a spade trick, the defenders can simply take the ♣A.

Since you may be in dummy for the last time, you might as well make use of dummy's ♦A-K. On dummy's ♦A, you can discard one of your spade losers. On dummy's ♦K, you can discard another spade loser. Both defenders continue to follow suit. Since you still have a spade and a club loser, you can try establishing dummy's diamonds. You lead another diamond from dummy and ruff with the ♥10. Good news. Both defenders follow suit to the third round of diamonds. Dummy's remaining diamonds are all winners. The bad news is you don't have a sure entry to reach them.

You might as well draw the defenders' trumps. Both defenders follow to the first round of hearts. Both defenders follow a second time when you play a high heart. Both defenders follow once more on the third round of hearts. That takes care of the defenders' trumps. They have divided 3-3.

Now all you have to do is to get to those winning diamonds in dummy. Suppose you try leading a sneaky low club toward dummy's ♣J. Unfortunately, West sees what you are up to and rises with the ♣A. West leads another club and you have to win it in your hand. So much for that ploy.

Sooner or later, you are going to have to lose a spade trick. Down one. You had a good idea, but it didn't quite work. Too bad West didn't let you get to dummy with the ♣J.

So how did Charles Solomon solve the problem?

Let's see.

## The Actual Play

Against Solomon, West got off to the same lead, the ♠9.

From the auction, Solomon was certain this was a singleton, with East holding the rest of the spades. He won the first trick with dummy's ♠A as East made an encouraging attitude signal with the ♠8.

Solomon realized the only way to make the contract was to establish dummy's diamonds and then reach dummy with the ♣J. To do that, however, he could see that the ♣K and ♣Q in his hand actually presented a problem. So he made an unusual play.

He took a trick with dummy's ♦A and, on it, discarded the ♣K!

He continued with the ♦K and discarded the ♣Q.

He then led a third round of diamonds from dummy and ruffed with the ♥A... for a bit of dramatic effect. When both defenders followed with diamonds, dummy's remaining diamonds became established winners. Next, he started drawing the defenders' trumps with the ♥K. Both defenders followed with low hearts. On another high heart, both defenders again followed suit. On the third high heart, both defenders again followed with low hearts. That took care of the defenders' trumps.

Solomon then put his creative plan into action.

He led his remaining low club toward dummy.

What could West do about that?

If West played low, dummy's ♣J would win and declarer could discard any remaining losers on dummy's diamonds. So West had to win the ♣A. But what could West do next?

With nothing left except clubs, West had to lead one. Dummy's ♣J won, and Solomon discarded a spade on it. Having reached dummy, Solomon could discard another spade loser on one of dummy's diamond winners. And his last spade loser went on another of dummy's diamond winners.

Solomon had the rest of the tricks with nothing but trump winners left. He had made the 6♥ contract, losing only a club trick.

The opponents' bidding on this deal pushed North-South into a poor contract. However, it also helped Solomon make the contract. He could visualize how the opponents' cards might lie so the contract could be made. It required a little luck as the diamonds divided 3-3, but Solomon was then able to take advantage and make the contract.
