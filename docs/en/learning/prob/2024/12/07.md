On this deal, how can you take advantage of the defenders' distribution?

<Badge type="warning" text="Play"/>

## The Auction

<table class="hand">
	<tr>
		<td>♠ AT9<br>♥ AKQT8<br>♦ 872<br>♣ Q6</td>
	</tr>
</table>

You are sitting South. The opponents are vulnerable and your side is not. Partner, North, is the dealer and opens 1♦. East overcalls 2♣. You have to choose a call after this start.

With 15 high-card points plus 1 length point for a five-card heart suit, you have more than enough to respond at the two level, showing the heart suit. 2♥ promises a five-card or longer suit. With only four hearts, you would start with a negative double.

West advances East's overcall to 3♣. Partner now raises to 3♥, and East competes further with 3♠. The auction is back to you.

That's a lot of bidding from everyone when you have 16 points. East presumably has a very distributional hand with clubs and spades. Having found a heart fit, however, you simply continue to 4♥.

Everyone passes. You are now the declarer in 4♥ and have to find a way to take ten tricks.

## Planning the Play

West leads the ♠5, and partner puts down the dummy.

<table class="deal">
	<tr>
		<td></td>
		<td>♠ K87<br>♥ J742<br>♦ AK95<br>♣ 32</td>
		<td></td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>♠ <br>♥ <br>♦ <br>♣ </td>
		<td><pre>   N<br>W     E<br>   S</pre></td>
		<td>♠ <br>♥ <br>♦ <br>♣ </td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td></td>
		<td>♠ AT9<br>♥ AKQT8<br>♦ 872<br>♣ Q6</td>
		<td></td>
	</tr>
</table>

Partner has four-card heart support but a minimum opening bid. You have some work to do.

You start by considering the potential losers in 4♥. You don't have any losers in the trump suit. The hearts are solid. You'll be left with a potential spade loser after the and ♠K are gone. You'll also be left with a potential diamond loser once the ♦A and ♦K are gone. There are two sure club losers since the opponents have the ♣A and ♣K. So you start with four potential losers: a spade, two clubs, and a diamond. One will have to be eliminated.

You can't do anything about the two club losers or the diamond loser. So it looks as though you are going to have to do something about the spade loser.

West has led the ♠5. If West started with either the ♠J or ♠Q, you will be able to capture East's honor with the ♠A and then trap West's remaining honor. Is that likely?

No. East bid spades at the three level in the auction. It looks more likely that East has a five-card spade suit headed by the ♠Q-J, and West is leading top of a doubleton.

Another possibility for eliminating the spade loser is to develop an extra diamond winner in dummy on which to discard a spade. You can do that if the six missing diamonds are divided 3-3. Is that likely?

No. East bid clubs and spades during the auction and presumably has a very distributional hand, likely six clubs and five spades. So East is unlikely to have more than two diamonds.

Even if the defenders' diamonds are divided 4-2 or 5-1 , you might still be able to develop a diamond winner if East started with a singleton diamond honor or a doubleton with two honors, such as the ♦Q-10.

So let's see how the play might go.

## Possible Play

West has led the ♠5. You play low from dummy, East plays the ♠J, and you win the ♠A. What next?

It seems reasonable to draw the defenders' trumps. Both defenders follow suit on the first round of trumps. On the second round of trumps, West follows but East shows out, discarding a club. You draw West's last trump as East discards a spade.

Now you can try the diamonds. You lead a low diamond to dummy's ♦K. Both defenders follow but no honor appears. You continue with another round of diamonds, but East shows out. So much for trying to establish an extra diamond winner. You have to lose a diamond trick.

West leads a spade and you try finessing dummy's ♠10 but East wins the ♠Q.

You still have two clubs to lose, and the 4♥ contract is down one. With East holding both the and and the diamonds not breaking, it seems you are always destined to go down one trick.

When this actual deal was played in the 1970 Vanderbilt Team Championship, sitting South was George Rapeé of New York. Let's see how he handled the play.

## The Actual Play

George Rapeé got the same opening lead of a spade. He played low from dummy and won East's ♠J with the ♠A. He drew a round of trumps as both defenders followed suit.

At trick three, he led a diamond to dummy's ♦K. He did this for two reasons. First, to see if an honor appeared from East, in which case a diamond winner could be established by finessing against West. Second, to eliminate East's diamond, assuming East started with only a singleton. Only low diamonds appeared.

He next played a low club from dummy and played low from his hand, letting West win the trick. West continued with another spade and Rapeé won with dummy's ♠K.

He then drew a second round of trumps as East showed out, as expected. He drew West's last trump, ending in dummy.

Let's look at the remaining cards.

<table class="deal">
	<tr>
		<td></td>
		<td>♠ 8<br>♥ 7<br>♦ A95<br>♣ 3</td>
		<td></td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>♠ <br>♥ <br>♦ QJT6<br>♣ AT</td>
		<td><pre>   N<br>W     E<br>   S</pre></td>
		<td>♠ Q42<br>♥ <br>♦ <br>♣ KJ4</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td></td>
		<td>♠ T<br>♥ QT<br>♦ 87<br>♣ Q</td>
		<td></td>
	</tr>
</table>

Rapeé then had the position he wanted. He could force the defenders to give him the extra trick he needed.

He led the last club from dummy, and it didn't matter which defender won the trick. Suppose East played low and West won the ♣A. West could lead a diamond, but Rapeé could win with dummy's ♦A as East showed out.

He could give up a spade trick to East. With nothing but clubs and spades remaining, East had to lead one, giving declarer a ruff and a sluff. He could discard the diamond loser from his hand and ruff in dummy.

With only trumps remaining in his hand, he had the last two tricks, making the 4♥ contract. He lost a spade and two clubs, but no diamonds.

However, would the result have been different if East, instead of West, had won the trick when the last club was led from dummy?

Let's look.

## An Alternative Play

Here are the cards in all four hands when declarer led a club from dummy.

<table class="deal">
	<tr>
		<td></td>
		<td>♠ 8<br>♥ 7<br>♦ A95<br>♣ 3</td>
		<td></td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>♠ <br>♥ <br>♦ QJT6<br>♣ AT</td>
		<td><pre>   N<br>W     E<br>   S</pre></td>
		<td>♠ Q42<br>♥ <br>♦ <br>♣ KJ4</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td></td>
		<td>♠ T<br>♥ QT<br>♦ 87<br>♣ Q</td>
		<td></td>
	</tr>
</table>

Suppose East had won the trick with the ♣K. East could take the spade winner. But, again, East then had nothing to lead except a club or a spade, giving declarer a ruff and a sluff. Declarer could discard a diamond loser and ruff in dummy.

Declarer had the rest of the tricks, losing only a spade and two clubs, but no diamond trick.

## The Rest of the Story

<table class="deal">
	<tr>
		<td></td>
		<td>♠ K87<br>♥ J742<br>♦ AK95<br>♣ 32</td>
		<td></td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>♠ 53<br>♥ 653<br>♦ QJT64<br>♣ AT4</td>
		<td><pre>   N<br>W     E<br>   S</pre></td>
		<td>♠ QJ642<br>♥ 9<br>♦ 3<br>♣ KJ9854</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td></td>
		<td>♠ AT9<br>♥ AKQT8<br>♦ 872<br>♣ Q6</td>

	</tr>

The technique George Rapeé used to make the contract is the end play. It didn't matter which defender won the second club. There was no way to avoid giving declarer a ruff and a sluff to make the contract.

George Rapeé was born and raised in New York City. His parents were from Hungary. His father was a concert pianist and orchestra conductor. After earning a law degree at New York University and serving in the army for three years during World War II, he became an attorney and real estate investor.

Rapeé is credited with inventing the Stayman convention, although it was independently developed by Jack Marx in the United Kingdom. Rapeé had the idea in 1940, and his long-time partner, Sam Stayman, enlarged and publicized the idea. Since it was first published under Stayman's name, it has been called "Stayman" ever since.

Rapeé won his first national title in 1936, at age 21. He was still winning tournaments 60 years later. From 1942 to 1980, he was the most successful player in the American Contract Bridge League's three most important team-of-four events, the Vanderbilt, Spingold, and Reisinger.

Rapeé was a member of the teams that won the first three Bermuda Bowls, representing America against Europe. In 1997, he was inducted into the American Contract Bridge League Hall of Fame.
