On this deal, partner has given you an excellent dummy, but is that enough?

## The Auction

<table class="hand">
	<tr>
		<td>♠ J3<br>♥ QJ986532<br>♦ J<br>♣ T2</td>
	</tr>
</table>

This is an actual deal from many years ago. Both sides were vulnerable and Eddie Kantar was in the South seat. His partner, North, was the dealer and opened 1♣. East passed, and Kantar had to choose a response.

Kantar had 5 high-card points plus 4 length points for the eight-card heart suit. It's enough to respond at the one level. Nowadays, some modern partnerships play a response of 2♥ as a weak jump shift. However, this deal was played before that idea had even been suggested. So let's go with straightforward response of 1♥, which is what Kantar bid.

West passed, and partner made a strong jump shift to 2♠. East passed, and the auction was back to Kantar.

Kantar couldn't pass since the jump shift was forcing to at least game. With no particular support for either of partner's suits, he rebid the eight-card suit.

West passed, and partner rebid 3♠. East passed, and Kantar again had to decide what to do.

Partner presumably had five spades and five or more clubs. Still, Kantar's hand wasn't good for much other than playing with hearts as trumps. The hearts were long enough that they should make a suitable trump suit if partner had only a singleton, or perhaps even if partner had a void. He rebid 4♥. Let's go with that.

West passed, and partner raised to 5♥. East passed, and again Kantar had to decide what to do.

In some situations, partner's raise to 5♥ would be asking whether South had a control in diamonds. However, that was unlikely to be the case here. Having shown at least ten cards in clubs and spades, partner couldn't have both the ♥A-K and two diamond losers. It was time to pass, hoping the partnership wasn't too high.

West also passed, and Kantar was the declarer in 5♥ with West on lead.

## Planning the Play

West led the ♦A, and partner put down the dummy.

Partner certainly had a good hand, 22 high-card points plus 1 length point for each five-card suit. With five spades and five clubs, most of today's players would open 1♠ rather than 1♣, or perhaps have started with a strong artificial 2♣ opening. However, that was how the auction went long ago. Before we see how Kantar handled the play, let's see what you will do as declarer in the South position.

You start by considering your potential losers in 5♥. You have a sure heart loser since you are missing the ♥A. You will have a second heart loser if the four missing hearts are divided 4-0 because you are also missing the ♥10. You'll have to hope that's not the case since you can't make the contract if you have two heart losers. You don't have any spade or club losers, but you do have a diamond loser. You are going to lose that right away since West has led the ♦A. So you have a sure heart loser and a sure diamond loser. You can't afford any more losers.

Unless the hearts break badly, it looks like you should be okay. Are there any potential problems?

The only danger is if an opponent can ruff one of your winners, or overruff if you ruff with a low heart. Let's see how the play might go.

## Possible Play

West has led the ♦A, which wins the first trick as East makes an encouraging attitude signal with the ♦8. West leads another diamond and East plays the ♦K. You ruff this trick. Now what?

Since the only danger is that the defenders may be able to get more than one heart trick, it looks right to start drawing the defenders' trumps. You lead a low heart to dummy's ♥K. This wins the trick as both defenders follow with low hearts. That's good news. The defenders' hearts haven't divided 4-0. You are at the critical point in the play. What are you doing next?

You need to get back to your hand so you can continue drawing the defenders' trumps. It looks as though the easiest way is to cross to your hand with a club. Let's see what will happen.

Suppose you come back to your hand with the ♣10. Both defenders follow with low clubs. You lead the ♥Q. If both defenders follow suit, you will have the rest of the tricks. West wins the ♥A, but East shows out. The hearts have divided 3-1 and West still has the ♥10.

West leads a club, and you have to win in dummy as East follows with another club. What problem do you have?

You need to get back to your hand to draw West's last trump. How can you do that safely?

Suppose you decide to get back to your hand by ruffing a spade. You take one of dummy's spade winners, and both defenders follow with low spades. You continue with another high spade, and both defenders follow again with low spades. You lead another spade from dummy and, when East follows with a low spade, you ruff with the ♥8.

Unfortunately, West overruffs with the ♥10. The defenders now have three tricks and the 5♥ contract is down one.

Maybe you should have tried to get back to your hand by ruffing a
club instead of a spade.

Here are all the remaining cards.

<table class="deal">
	<tr>
		<td></td>
		<td>♠ 6<br>♥ <br>♦ <br>♣ AKQ</td>
		<td></td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>♠ <br>♥ <br>♦ 9732<br>♣ </td>
		<td><pre>   N<br>W     E<br>   S</pre></td>
		<td>♠ Q<br>♥ <br>♦ 6<br>♣ 98</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td></td>
		<td>♠ <br>♥ J965<br>♦ <br>♣ </td>
		<td></td>
	</tr>
</table>

You can see that West also has no clubs left. Unlucky. West started with both a doubleton spade and a doubleton club. So it wouldn't have mattered if you led a club instead of a spade from dummy. If you led a club and ruffed with the ♥8, West would overruff with the ♥10. You couldn't get back to your hand to draw West's last trump. 5♥ would again be down one.

So how did Edie Kantar handle the contract?

## Recommended Play

Kantar got the same opening lead of the ♦A. West won the first trick. West continued with a second diamond to East's ♦K, and Kantar ruffed. He led a heart to dummy's ♥K, and West made the good defensive play of letting dummy's ♥K win. Kantar was at the critical point in the play.

He looked ahead and could see the potential problem if he crossed back with the ♣10 to play another round of trumps. If West had both remaining trumps, the ♥A and ♥10, West could lead a spade or a club, putting him back in dummy. He'd then had to guess how to get back to his hand and, as you've seen, it may not even be possible. So he found a neat solution.

He took a trick with one of dummy's high spades.

He took another trick with dummy's remaining high spade.

This ran the slight risk that one of the defenders had started with a singleton spade, but that was less likely than a defender starting with two spades.

He then made another key play.

He took a trick with one of dummy's high clubs.

Finally, he came back to his hand with the ♣10. Again, he was running the slight risk that a defender had started with a singleton club, but this was less likely than a defender starting with a doubleton club.

When neither defender was able to ruff, the contract was secure. Kantar led the ♥Q to drive out West's ♥A. East showed out, but that was okay. Since he had taken two spade tricks and two club tricks, West could no longer put him in dummy and make it difficult or impossible to safely get back to his hand. Whatever West led, Kantar had the rest of the tricks.

West led a diamond, and Kantar ruffed in his hand with a low trump. He then drew West's last trump, the ♥10, with the ♥J. With the defenders' trumps all gone, he had the rest of the tricks. He made the 5♥ contract, losing only one diamond and **one** heart.

The technique Eddie Kantar used to make the contract is referred to as a "dentist's coup.'

The play of the ♠A-K "extracted" West's safe exit cards in spades. The play of the ♣A followed by the ♣10 "extracted" West's safe exit cards in clubs. West could no longer put Kantar on the table at an inopportune time. West was left with nothing to lead but diamonds. Even if West had a spade or a club to lead, that would be okay. Kantar could ruff in his hand and draw the last trump.

Well played!

He was also a regular contributor to the ACBL Bulletin, The Bridge World, Bridge Today, and Better Bridge. A two-time World Champion, Eddie was highly regarded as a player and was one of the game's greatest ambassadors.

When Eddie taught, he had a great sense of humor and loved to hear his students laugh. He had over 150 favorite stories that he liked to fit in when appropriate.

One of his favorites was about Eric Paulsen who won a world championship and was back playing one day in his local club. His opponents competed to 3♥, and Paulsen decided to bid 3♠, even though he knew it wasn't going to make. He didn't expect to be doubled since he was a world champion. However, the player on his left did double.

Eric looked at him and said, "Do you know who I am?"

The opponent replied, "Yes, I know who you are."

Eric then said, "Do you know how many masterpoints I have?"

The opponent replied, "No, but do you know how many spades I have?"
