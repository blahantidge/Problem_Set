Today's quiz is based on Audrey Grant Improving Your Judgment 1: Opening the Bidding - Strong Balanced Opening Bids.

<Badge type="danger" text="Bid"/>

## Introduction

### Strong Balanced Opening Bids

Some hands have so much strength that they are likely to make game opposite little or no strength from partner.

With this hand, for example, ten tricks can be expected with hearts
as trumps even if partner has no points and no hearts.

<table class="hand">
	<tr>
		<td>♠ 8<br>♥ AKQJ865<br>♦ A6<br>♣ AK5</td>
	</tr>
</table>

If South opened 1♥, there is the possibility that partner will pass and a game would be missed. If South were to open 4♥, there's not much room to explore for slam. Twelve tricks are possible if partner has as little as the ♦K and ♣Q. In addition, today most partnerships play an opening bid of 4♥ as preemptive, showing an 8-card suit and less than game values.

Traditionally such hands were opened with a strong two-bid, 2♥. This was forcing, so partner couldn't pass, and it left room to look for slam. With the advent of weak two-bids, however, opening bids of 2♦, 2▼, 2♠ are no longer used to show strong hands. Instead, all strong hands of about 22 or more points are opened with an artificial forcing 2♣.

Using the artificial 2♣ opening with strong hands of 22 or more points affects the ranges used for showing balanced hands.

- 0-11/12 Pass
- 12/13-14 Open one-of-a-suit, planning to rebid notrump at the cheapest available level
- 15-17 Open 1NT
- 18-19 Open one-of-a-suit, planning to rebid notrump jumping a level
- 20-21 Open 2NT
- 22-24 Open 2♣, planning to rebid 2NT
- 25-27 Open 2♣, planning to rebid 3NT

<table class="hand">
	<tr>
		<td>♠ KJ8<br>♥ AQ9<br>♦ KQ75<br>♣ AJ6</td>
	</tr>
</table>

This hand has 20 high-card points. Open 2NT showing a balanced hand of 20-21 points.

When opener shows a balanced hand, responder is not forced to bid again and can pass with a weak hand. Responder can also use similar partnership methods to those used after a 1NT opening bid.

What about stronger balanced hands?

<table class="hand">
	<tr>
		<td>♠ AJ75<br>♥ KJT4<br>♦ AQ<br>♣ AKT</td>
	</tr>
</table>

With 22 high-card points, this (South) hand is too strong to open 2NT. Instead, South starts with 2♣. Responder usually makes an artificial waiting response of 2♦, leaving opener room to describe the hand. South will rebid 2NT showing a balanced hand of 22-24 points. Partner can pass without enough for game or use Stayman or transfers similar to after 1NT, one level higher.

At one time, an opening bid of 3NT showed a balanced hand with enough strength for game opposite little or nothing in partner's hand, 25 or more points. Since 2♣ is used for all hands with 22 or more points, rebids of notrump show 3-point ranges, i.e. 22-24, 25-27, 28-30. 

<table class="hand">
	<tr>
		<td>♠ AKT8<br>♥ KQJ<br>♦ AQJ<br>♣ AK8</td>
	</tr>
</table>

With this (South) hand, South would start with 2♣ and if partner responds 2♦, rebid 3NT, showing a balanced hand with 25-27 points. After a 3NT rebid, partnerships can agree to use 4♣ as Stayman and 4♦ and 4♥ as transfers.

Since an opening bid of 3NT is no longer needed to show a strong balanced hand, it can be assigned another meaning by the partnership. Some partnerships use an opening 3NT to show a solid seven- or eight-card minor suit with very little outside strength, this is referred to as a gambling 3NT.

When opening 2♣ and rebidding strong hands, be prepared to exercise some judgment.

Consider this hand.

<table class="hand">
	<tr>
		<td>♠ AKJ<br>♥ K5<br>♦ AKQ875<br>♣ K4</td>
	</tr>
</table>

This (South) hand should definitely be opened 2♣, with 23 high-card points plus 2 length points for the six-card diamond suit. If partner responds 2♦, a rebid of 3♦ may leave partner awkwardly placed with a very weak hand. If partner bids 3NT, this hand goes down as dummy. A heart or club opening lead may trap the king and allow the defenders to take enough tricks to defeat the contract. Instead of rebidding 3♦, a more practical rebid is 3NT, treating the hand as balanced with 25-27 points. If the opening lead is a spade, a heart, or a club, South should easily be able to take nine tricks.

</table>

#### Suggested Answer

**2♣**

With a balanced hand and 23 high-card points, open the bidding 2♣. The hand is too strong to open 2NT.

### 03

You are South. Both sides are vulnerable.

<table class="hand">
	<tr>
		<td>♠ AK85<br>♥ AQ<br>♦ AKQ8<br>♣ KQ7</td>
	</tr>
</table>

		<th>South</th>
		<th>West</th>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td></td>
		<td></td>
		<td>?</td>
		<td></td>
	</tr>
</table>

#### Suggested Answer

**2♣**

This is an old-fashioned 3NT opening with 25-27 points. Playing weak two-bids, however, it is opened 2♣，planning to rebid 3NT.

### 04

You are South. Both sides are vulnerable.

<table class="hand">
	<tr>
		<td>♠ AK5<br>♥ K4<br>♦ AQJ87<br>♣ QT5</td>
	</tr>
</table>

	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td></td>
		<td></td>
		<td>?</td>
		<td></td>
	</tr>
</table>

#### Suggested Answer

**2NT**

19 high-card points plus 1 for the five-card diamond suit make this hand worth a 2NT opening bid.

### 05

You are South. Both sides are vulnerable.

<table class="hand">
	<tr>
		<td>♠ AQ<br>♥ KQJ9<br>♦ AJ<br>♣ K8742</td>
	</tr>
</table>

<table class="auction">

		<th>South</th>
		<th>West</th>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td></td>
		<td></td>
		<td>?</td>
		<td></td>
	</tr>
</table>

#### Suggested Answer

**2NT**

With 5-4-2-2 distribution, this hand is not quite balanced. 1♣ would be the textbook opening bid, planning to rebid hearts strongly - by reversing or jump-shifting. However, with a poor club suit and two strong doubletons, it might be better to simply open 2NT.

### 06

You are South. Your side is vulnerable and the opponents are not.

<table class="hand">
	<tr>
		<td>♠ KQT8<br>♥ AKQ<br>♦ J9<br>♣ AQJ7</td>
	</tr>
</table>

<table class="auction">

		<td>2♣</td>
		<td>Pass</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>2♦</td>
		<td>Pass</td>
		<td>?</td>
		<td></td>
	</tr>
</table>

#### Suggested Answer

**2NT**

This shows a balanced hand with 22-24 points. Don't worry about the lack of a sure stopper in diamonds.

### 07

You are South. Your side is vulnerable and the opponents are not.

<table class="hand">
	<tr>
		<td>♠ AJ<br>♥ KQJ8<br>♦ AKQ7<br>♣ AJ3</td>
	</tr>

		<td></td>
		<td>2♣</td>
		<td>Pass</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>2♦</td>
		<td>Pass</td>
		<td>?</td>
		<td></td>
	</tr>
</table>

#### Suggested Answer

**3NT**

This rebid shows a balanced hand with 25-27 points.

### 08

You are South. Your side is vulnerable and the opponents are not.

<table class="hand">
	<tr>
		<td>♠ AQ<br>♥ KQ9<br>♦ A93<br>♣ AQT84</td>
	</tr>
</table>

<table class="auction">
	<tr>
		<th>North</th>
		<th>East</th>
		<th>South</th>
		<th>West</th>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td></td>
		<td></td>
		<td>2♣</td>
		<td>Pass</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>2♦</td>
		<td>Pass</td>
		<td>?</td>
		<td></td>
	</tr>
</table>

#### Suggested Answer

**2NT**

The hand is balanced with 21 high-card points and 1 length point for the five-card club suit so it was too strong to open 2NT initially.

### 09

You are South. Your side is vulnerable and the opponents are not.

<table class="hand">
	<tr>
		<td>♠ AK<br>♥ K3<br>♦ AKQ863<br>♣ KJ5</td>
	</tr>
</table>

<table class="auction">
	<tr>
		<th>North</th>
		<th>East</th>
		<th>South</th>
		<th>West</th>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td></td>
		<td></td>
		<td>2♣</td>
		<td>Pass</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>2♦</td>
		<td>Pass</td>
		<td>?</td>
		<td></td>
	</tr>
</table>

#### Suggested Answer

**3NT (3♦)**

Treat this as a strong balanced hand. If you rebid 3◆, partner may be awkwardly placed. 3NT is more likely to be successful with your hand as declarer rather than as dummy.

### 10

You are South. Your side is vulnerable and the opponents are not.

<table class="hand">
	<tr>
		<td>♠ AK<br>♥ KQJ4<br>♦ KQJ<br>♣ AKQJ</td>
	</tr>
</table>

<table class="auction">
	<tr>
		<th>North</th>
		<th>East</th>
		<th>South</th>
		<th>West</th>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td></td>
		<td></td>
		<td>2♣</td>
		<td>Pass</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>2♦</td>
		<td>Pass</td>
		<td>?</td>
		<td></td>
	</tr>
</table>

#### Suggested Answer

**4NT**

This shows a balanced hand of 28-30 points, is not forcing, and doesn't ask for aces.
