On this deal, you got a fortunate opening lead, but it will still take a brilliant play to make your slam.

<Badge type="warning" text="Play"/>

## The Auction

<table class="hand">
	<tr>
		<td>♠ QJ6<br>♥ QT9<br>♦ A4<br>♣ AQJT7</td>
	</tr>
</table>

Suppose you are the dealer sitting South. With neither side vulnerable, you have to choose an opening bid.

The hand is balanced with 16 high-card points plus 1 length point for the five-card club suit. That's at the top of the range for a 1NT opening, showing 15-17 points.

West passes, and partner, North, responds 2♣, the Stayman convention. East passes, and you have to choose a reply.

With no four-card or longer major, you make the artificial reply of 2♦.

West passes, and partner raises all the way to 6NT. East passes. The auction is back to you.

Having described the hand with the 1NT opening and 2♦ rebid, you have nothing further to say after partner chooses to play a slam contract in 6NT. You pass.

West passes, and you are now the declarer in 6NT with West on lead.

## Planning the Play

West leads the ♠3, and partner puts down the dummy.

<table class="deal">
	<tr>
		<td></td>
		<td>♠ AK7<br>♥ J752<br>♦ KQ952<br>♣ K</td>
		<td></td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>♠ <br>♥ <br>♦ <br>♣ </td>
		<td><pre>   N<br>W     E<br>   S</pre></td>
		<td>♠ <br>♥ <br>♦ <br>♣ </td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td></td>
		<td>♠ QJ6<br>♥ QT9<br>♦ A4<br>♣ AQJT7</td>
		<td></td>
	</tr>
</table>

You have got off to a fortunate start. The opponents could have taken the top two heart tricks to defeat the contract right away. Fortunately, West has led a spade rather than a heart. West obviously doesn't have the ♥A-K.

Partner might have overbid slightly. Partner has 16 high-card points plus 1 length point for the five-card diamond suit. Partner might have made only an invitational raise of 4NT after finding there is no eight-card major suit fit. However, with 17 points, you would have accepted the invitation and landed in the same contract. You must now focus on taking twelve tricks in 6NT.

As in any notrump contract, you start by counting the sure winners. You have three spade tricks: the ♠A, ♠K, and ♠Q. Unfortunately, the ♠J is wasted. There are no sure heart tricks... and there aren't likely to be any tricks since the opponents hold the ♥A-K! There are five sure club tricks. You have a five-card club suit and the top five club honors. There are also three sure diamond winners, the ♠A, ♠K, and ♠Q. So that gives you a starting total of eleven tricks: three spades, five clubs, and three diamonds. You need to find one more trick.

You aren't getting any more tricks from clubs or spades.

In hearts, you could promote two heart winners, but that would require giving up two tricks in the suit. Not a good idea in a slam!

That leaves the diamond suit. In diamonds, you will get two extra tricks through length if the six missing diamonds are divided exactly 3-3 in the defenders' hands. If that's the case, you'll actually make an overtrick. The odds of the diamonds being divided 3-3 are only 36%, but that's better than nothing. If the defenders' diamonds are divided 4-2, which is more likely, you can get an extra trick through length by giving up a diamond trick. Of course, that suffers from the same problem that the defenders can take their two heart winners when they gain the lead. So it looks as though you will need a favorable lie of the defenders' diamonds.

It can't hurt to take your spade and club winners in the meantime. Perhaps one or both defenders will discard diamonds, improving your odds. Let's see how the play might go.

## Possible Play

West has led the ♠3. Suppose you win with dummy's ♠K, keeping an entry to your hand so you can easily take all your club winners. You take a trick with dummy's ♣K. Both defenders follow suit. You cross to your hand with the ♣Q. You take a trick with the ♣A, discarding a heart from dummy. Both defenders follow suit with low clubs. You take a trick with the ♣Q, discarding another heart from dummy. Again, both defenders follow. You take a trick with the ♣J. West shows out, discarding a spade, and East follows with the defenders' last club. You take your last club winner. West discards another spade, you discard dummy's last heart, and East also discards a heart. Neither of the defenders has discarded any diamonds.

Time to find out what's going on in diamonds. You take a trick with the ♦A. Both defenders follow with low diamonds. No doubleton ♦J-10. You play a diamond to dummy's ♦Q. Both defenders again follow suit. That's the good news. However, East's ♦J is an ominous sign. You play the ♦K. East shows out, discarding a heart, as West follows. The defenders' diamonds have divided 4-2 and West still has the ♦10 remaining. Definitely no overtrick!

The best you can do at this point is give up a diamond trick to West and hope West has only spades remaining. Unfortunately, West still has a heart, the ♥K. And West has a second heart to lead to East's ♥A.

6NT has gone down two, losing a diamond and two hearts.

Perhaps you should have taken the ♠A when you had a chance. Well, it could have gone down right away if the defenders had taken their heart winners.

When this actual deal was played, sitting South as declarer was Mervin Key of Houston, Texas. Let's see how he fared in the contract.

## The Actual Play

The auction went a little differently when Mervin Key and his partner bid the hands, but the final contract was the same. Key got the same fortunate opening lead of the ♠3 from West, giving him a chance.

He won the first trick in dummy. He took the ♣K to unblock the suit. He crossed to his hand with a spade. He took one of the club winners, discarding a heart from dummy. He took another club, discarding a second heart from dummy. When he played his last club, however, he made a critical play.

Instead of discarding dummy's last heart, he discarded a low diamond from dummy.

This gave up on the chance of taking all thirteen tricks, but that wasn't his objective. He needed only twelve. If the defenders' diamonds were divided 3-3, he would still make the contract.

Let's look at the remaining cards at this point.

<table class="deal">
	<tr>
		<td></td>
		<td>♠ A<br>♥ J<br>♦ KQ95<br>♣ </td>
		<td></td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>♠ <br>♥ K6<br>♦ T876<br>♣ </td>
		<td><pre>   N<br>W     E<br>   S</pre></td>
		<td>♠ <br>♥ A843<br>♦ J3<br>♣ </td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td></td>
		<td>♠ J<br>♥ QT9<br>♦ A4<br>♣ </td>
		<td></td>
	</tr>
</table>

West had held on to all four diamonds and the doubleton ♥K. East had held on to all four hearts and two diamonds.

Key then made another critical play.

He led the ♠J.

West couldn't afford to discard a diamond or all of dummy's diamonds would become winners. So West had to discard the ♥6, coming down to a singleton ♥K.

Key played a diamond to the ♦A, and both defenders followed with low diamonds. He continued with a diamond to dummy's ♦Q. West followed with another low diamond and East with the ♦J.

These were the remaining cards.

<table class="deal">
	<tr>
		<td></td>
		<td>♠ <br>♥ J<br>♦ K9<br>♣ </td>
		<td></td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>♠ <br>♥ K<br>♦ T8<br>♣ </td>
		<td><pre>   N<br>W     E<br>   S</pre></td>
		<td>♠ <br>♥ A43<br>♦ <br>♣ </td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td></td>
		<td>♠ <br>♥ QT9<br>♦ <br>♣ </td>
		<td></td>
	</tr>
</table>

Key had to determine if the two remaining diamonds would fall under the ♦K or whether one defender, presumably West, had both remaining diamonds. He decided from the fall of East's ♦J on the previous trick that West had both the diamonds. So he made another critical play.

He led dummy's carefully preserved ♥J.

What could East do?

If East played the ♥A, West's ♥K would fall on the same trick. East would then have to lead a heart and both of declarer's remaining hearts would become winners. So East had to play a low heart. Key followed with a low heart, and West won the ♥K.

West had nothing left to lead except a diamond. Key knew West held both remaining diamonds. Otherwise, West could have led a spade or a heart. So he confidently finessed dummy's ♦9, which won the trick. Dummy's ♦K was his twelfth trick.

Key had made the slam, losing only one heart trick. He took three spades, five clubs, and four diamond tricks.

## The Rest of the Story

<table class="deal">
	<tr>
		<td></td>
		<td>♠ AK7<br>♥ J752<br>♦ KQ952<br>♣ K</td>
		<td></td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>♠ T543<br>♥ K6<br>♦ T876<br>♣ 863</td>
		<td><pre>   N<br>W     E<br>   S</pre></td>
		<td>♠ 982<br>♥ A843<br>♦ J3<br>♣ 9542</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td></td>
		<td>♠ QJ6<br>♥ QT9<br>♦ A4<br>♣ AQJT7</td>
		<td></td>
	</tr>
</table>

The rare play that Key used to make the contract is called a "winkle."

When Key led the ♥J, the defenders had no winning reply. If East won the ♥A, West's ♥K would fall and East would be endplayed into leading a heart, giving declarer the last two tricks. If East played low, West would win the trick and would then be endplayed into giving declarer the last two tricks by leading a diamond.

David Mervin Key was born in Wichita Falls, Texas, in 1929. He grew up in Ada, Oklahoma, attending the University of Oklahoma and then completing Law School at the University of Houston. After serving in the Korean War, he passed the Texas bar exam in 1954.

He had learned to play bridge in 1948 and enjoyed the tales of his friend, John Hathorn, with whom he played his first duplicate game.

![](/image/2024/10/12/Key_2.png){style="margin: 0 auto"}

By the time Key returned from the war, Hathorn had become a good player, and Key quickly became an avid fan of the game. The partnership started winning tournaments and were soon on teams with such bridge luminaries as Sidney Lazard and Bobby Nail.

In 1962, Key represented North America in the World Bridge Championship, playing against England, Argentina, and the famous Italian Blue Team.

Key founded the Bridge Studio of Houston with Dick Sutton in 1958 and, when it moved to a new building in 1961, he operated it together with Bobby Nail.

He continued his law practice until 1997 but he also got involved in real estate, which resulted in his move to Belize. In 1980, he financed and built the Victoria House hotel in San Pedro. He also opened Mervin's Hole-in-the-Wall where he introduced locals to hot dogs and hamburgers. In his seventies, he learned to build websites and created and maintained a Korean veteran site mervino.com that was dedicated to his fellow soldiers.
