In today's deal, can you stop the opponents from making a slam contract?

<Badge type="tip" text="Defense"/>

## The Auction

<table class="hand">
	<tr>
		<td>♠ J8<br>♥ J3<br>♦ 9732<br>♣ KQJ32</td>
	</tr>
</table>

Suppose you are sitting South with both sides vulnerable. East is the dealer and opens with a strong artificial 2♣. You have a first chance to make a call.

You have a decent club suit, but the hand is too weak to try to interfere in the opponents' auction, especially vulnerable. You might double the artificial 2♣ bid to show clubs, but that's probably unnecessary since you are likely to be on lead against the opponents' contract. You pass.

West makes an artificial waiting bid of 2♦. Your partner, North, passes, and East bids 2♥, showing a strong hand with a good heart suit. The auction is back to you.

There's still no reason to come into the auction. You pass.

West raises to 3♥, and your partner passes. East now bids 3♠. With hearts already agreed as a trump suit, this is presumably a control-showing bid, showing interest in slam. It's your turn to make a call.

Still no reason to take any action.

West bids 4♦, presumably a control-showing bid showing something useful in diamonds. Your partner passes. East now jumps to 6♥. The auction is back to you.

Naturally, you pass.

West and partner both pass, ending the auction. You will now be making the opening lead against East's 6♥ contract.

## The Opening Lead

The choice of opening lead is fairly straightforward. With a suit headed by the king-queen-jack, there is no reason to lead anything else but the top of the solid sequence.

## Possible Defense

You lead the ♣K, and dummy comes down.

<table class="deal">
	<tr>
		<td></td>
		<td>♠ <br>♥ <br>♦ <br>♣ </td>
		<td></td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>♠ Q9764<br>♥ 754<br>♦ K8<br>♣ T87</td>
		<td><pre>   N<br>W     E<br>   S</pre></td>
		<td>♠ <br>♥ <br>♦ <br>♣ </td>
	</tr>
	<tr>

		<td>♠ J8<br>♥ J3<br>♦ 9732<br>♣ KQJ32</td>
		<td></td>
	</tr>
</table>

Dummy doesn't have much, but does have three-card heart support and the ♦K.

A low club is played from dummy, partner plays the ♣9 and declarer follows with the ♣5. That seems like a good start. What next?

Partner has made an encouraging attitude signal in clubs, so there doesn't appear to be any reason to do anything except continue the suit. You play the ♣Q, partner finishes the encouraging attitude signal by playing the ♣4, and declarer ruffs this trick. That's not entirely unexpected. Declarer wouldn't have jumped to slam with two club losers.

Declarer plays the ♦4 to dummy's ♦K as both you and partner follow with low diamonds. Declarer next leads the ♥4 from dummy. Partner follows with the ♥2 and, after a moment's thought, plays the ♥Q. What are you playing to this trick?

It appears that declarer is taking a heart finesse, hoping your partner holds the ♥K. Too bad you don't have the ♥K.

It doesn't appear there is anything you can do for now except follow suit. Let's see what happens when you follow with a low heart.

You follow with a low heart, and declarer's ♥Q wins the trick. Declarer now plays the ♥A. Your ♥J falls on the trick and so does partner's ♥K.

Declarer claims the rest of the tricks.

That was a little unlucky. Declarer reached a poor slam contract that needed a finesse and was lucky enough to find your partner with a doubleton ♥K. It doesn't appear that there was anything you could have done.

When this actual deal was played in the Juan-les-Pins Bridge Festival in 1971, sitting South on defense was Jonathan Cansino. His partner was Boris Shapiro. The auction went a little differently since the North-South players were playing strong two-bids. However, the final contract was 6♥. Let's see what Jonathan Cansino did against East's slam contract.

## The Actual Defense

Cansino led the ♣K, winning the first trick. He continued with the ♣Q, and declarer ruffed this trick. Declarer crossed to dummy with the ♦K. Declarer then led a low heart from dummy and, when North followed with the ♥2, declarer, after some thought, finessed the ♥Q.

It was apparent that declarer was missing both the ♥K and ♥J and had to guess what to do. By guessing to play the ♥Q, declarer had made the right decision. So Jonathan Cansino decided to create an illusion in declarer's mind.

Without any hesitation, he played the ♥J!

This painted the picture in declarer's mind that North still held the ♥K-3. If there were the case, declarer had to get back to dummy to repeat the finesse. The only way for declarer to get back to dummy was by ruffing a diamond.

Declarer took a trick with the ♦A. Both defenders followed with low diamonds. Declarer led another diamond and, when Cansino followed suit, ruffed with one of dummy's hearts.

Unfortunately for declarer, North had started with only two diamonds and overruffed with the remaining singleton ♥K!

Declarer had the rest of the tricks, but 6♥ was down one. The defenders got a club trick and a heart trick, even though North started with a doubleton ♥K.

## The Rest of the Story

<table class="deal">
	<tr>
		<td></td>
		<td>♠ KT532<br>♥ K2<br>♦ 65<br>♣ A964</td>
		<td></td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>♠ Q9764<br>♥ 754<br>♦ K8<br>♣ T87</td>
		<td><pre>   N<br>W     E<br>   S</pre></td>
		<td>♠ A<br>♥ AQT986<br>♦ AQJT4<br>♣ 5</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td></td>
		<td>♠ J8<br>♥ J3<br>♦ 9732<br>♣ KQJ32</td>
		<td></td>
	</tr>
</table>

The nice thing about Cansino's falsecard - playing the ♥J to give the appearance that it was a singleton - was that it couldn't cost. If declarer ignored the play and continued with the ♥A, then there was nothing the defense could do. Playing the ♥J, however, presented declarer with a losing option. Cansino didn't know his partner held only two diamonds, but there was no harm in creating a false impression in declarer's mind.

Jonathan Cansino was born into a set of prominent families of Sephardic Jews in 1939 in London, England. During a half-term holiday while still at school, he was taught bridge by his uncle and a High Court judge. He represented Oxford in bridge competitions and became a stockbroker for a time. However, even though he had a talent for the stock market, bridge completely took over his life. He quickly rose to prominence in the bridge world, winning every major tournament in the country and playing for England internationally. Such was his reputation that, when the British Team went up to receive the Silver Medal in the European Team Championships in 1971, a chant of "Can-sin-o, Can-sin-o, Can-sin-o" went up from the audience... slightly to the chagrin of the other team members.

![](/image/2024/10/05/Cansino-2.png){style="margin: 0 auto"}

Cansino had a photographic memory, a wicked sense of humor, and the knack of reading the minds of his partners and opponents. He enjoyed playing for high stakes and, in 1970, challenged film star Omar Sharif and his traveling circus of leading bridge players to a televised game of rubber bridge for a staggering one pound per point. He lost, but the loss was covered by Crockford's, the London betting club, which sponsored the British team.

Along with developing the Cansino Defense to an opening 1NT bid, he developed the notorious Multi Two Diamond opening in partnership with Jeremy Flint. The use of a 2♦ opening to show a weak two-bid in either hearts or spades was considered revolutionary at the time, but it is now a popular convention throughout Europe and among many of the top North American partnerships. Cansino also developed the "Cansino Count" to determine whether to open a borderline hand in fourth position. This is more commonly known as the Guideline of 15.
