On this deal, can you make the contract safely?

## The Auction

<table class="hand">
	<tr>
		<td>♠ J43<br>♥ QJT9<br>♦ AKJ5<br>♣ A9</td>
	</tr>
</table>

Suppose you are the dealer sitting South. Your side is vulnerable and the opponents are not. You have to choose an opening call in first position.

You have 16 high-card points and a balanced hand. That's ideal for a 1NT opening bid when the partnership range is 15-17. West passes, and partner, North, responds 2♣. East passes, and the auction is back to you.

Partner's 2♣ is the Stayman convention, inquiring about four-card or longer major suits. With four hearts, you naturally show the suit.

West passes, and partner jumps to 4♣. East passes, and you have to determine what is going on.

Partner's jump to 4♣ is the Gerber convention. Partner is showing a fit for hearts and is asking about aces. Why didn't partner bid 4NT? That would be a quantitative raise, inviting slam, and showing that partner was interested in finding a spade fit, not a heart fit.

Playing standard responses to the Gerber convention, you reply 4♠ to show two aces. If the partnership is using key card responses to Gerber, the response would be 4NT, showing two key cards plus the queen of the "agreed" trump suit, the ♥Q.

West passes, and partner now bids 5♣. East passes, and the auction is back to you again.

In standard methods, 5♣ is a continuation of the Gerber convention, this time asking about kings. Presumably the partnership has all the aces and partner is interested in getting to a grand slam. With one king, the reply is 5♥. If playing key card responses, South might reply 5♦, specifically showing the ♦K, depending on the partnership agreements.

West passes, and partner bids 6♥. East passes, and you have another opportunity to make a call.

Partner has taken control by using the Gerber convention, and you have no reason to overrule partner's decision to play in a small slam in hearts. You pass.

West also passes, ending the auction. You are now the declarer in 6♥ with West on lead.

## Planning the Play

Against your small slam, West leads the ♠7. Partner puts down the dummy, and you can see why partner wanted to be in slam after finding a heart fit.

In planning the play in 6♥, you start by considering the potential losers. The trump suit is solid. There will be no losers unless the five missing hearts are divided 5-0. There is one potential spade loser since you are missing the ♠K. You will have two potential diamond losers after the ♦A and ♦K are gone. You don't have any club losers. So it appears you have a spade loser and two diamond losers. You can afford only one loser.

In spades, you can hope to avoid the loser with the help of a finesse if West holds the ♠K. That's a 50% chance.

In diamonds, you could plan to ruff both losers in dummy or discard one loser on an extra spade winner in dummy.

So it appears you have ways to potentially eliminate all the losers. Is there anything that can go wrong?

Let's see how the play might start off.

## Possible Play

West has led the ♠7. You are immediately faced with a decision. Should you try the spade finesse or win the ♠A?

Since you can avoid a spade loser if West holds the ♠K, it's tempting to play low, taking a finesse.

Let's see what will happen if you do on this deal. Suppose you play a low spade from dummy at trick one. East wins the trick with the ♠K. So much for avoiding the spade loser. East returns a spade and, unfortunately, West ruffs with a low heart. West led a singleton spade.

That's not a good start. The slam is down before you even get started.

This was an actual deal from the 1966 South African National Teams tournament between South Africa and England. The auction went a little differently, but the final contract was the same at 6♥. At one table, sitting South as declarer was Irving Rose, representing England. Let's see how Rose handled the contract.

## The Actual Play

West had led the ♠7, and Rose didn't want to risk the contract at trick one. He could afford a spade loser provided he eliminated both potential diamond losers. That was a better plan. He could always drive out the ♠K later after trumps were drawn.

So he won the first trick with dummy's ♠A.

What next?

He needed to ruff the two diamond losers in dummy, so he couldn't afford to draw all the defenders' trumps. In fact, to handle the entries back and forth, it was best to start the diamonds right away. He played a diamond to the ♦K. There was no rush to play the ♦A. Instead, Rose led a low diamond. When West followed with a low diamond, what do you think Rose played from dummy?

He could afford to ruff with the ♥K. Although it was unlikely East started with a singleton diamond, ruffing with the ♥K ensured he wouldn't be overruffed. It also helped with the entry situation. He then played a low heart from dummy to one of the winners in his hand. When both defenders followed suit, the contract was assured. Back in the South hand, it was convenient to lead the remaining diamond loser, the ♦J. When West followed with a low diamond, Rose could afford to ruff with dummy's other high heart.

After that, it was easy to get back to the South hand by leading dummy's remaining low heart. East showed out on this trick. The defenders' hearts had divided 4-1, but that was okay. Rose drew one of West's remaining trumps with a high heart and discarded a club from dummy. He drew West's last trump with his remaining high trump, discarding another club from dummy. There were no more trumps left, but that was fine.

Rose had everything under control. It was time to drive out the ♠K. West showed out on the trick. Rose was happy he didn't try the finesse at trick one.

After winning the ♠K, there was nothing East could do. Even though Rose had no trumps remaining, he had carefully kept the ♦A and the club winners so the opponents couldn't win a trick in either suit. East chose to lead back a club, and dummy's ♣K won the trick.

Rose had nothing but winners left, making the 6♥ slam contract. He lost only one spade trick.

## The Rest of the Story

When this deal arose, at the other table, the South African declarer took the spade finesse at trick one and went down immediately when East returned a spade. As we saw, however, Irving Rose showed the safe way to make twelve tricks by ruffing the two diamond losers with the ♥A-K and keeping low hearts in dummy to get back to the South hand and draw all the trumps. A spade trick could then safely be given up and the 6♥ contract was made.

Irving Rose was one of Britain's most talented and colorful players. He came from a bridge playing family. His father, Louis Rose, had won all the major Scottish events. Although all Irving wanted to do was play bridge, his father had other ideas, and he was sent to Glasgow University to study medicine. Irving, however, devoted most of his time to playing bridge, entering tournaments under an assumed name so his father wouldn't find out. The medical career was abandoned after a year, and Irving switched to accounting. All the time, he felt he wanted to move to London, the center of British bridge. Eventually, he made the move and, while working as an accountant during the day, he spent most of the night playing bridge. This led to his sleeping at work during the day and being asked to find alternative employment.

He eventually found the ideal job. He became manager of the bridge room at Crockford's Club and, later, at the Eccentric Club. His geniality and popularity made him a great success.

Unfortunately, playing high stakes rubber bridge encouraged him to gamble on other things. Eventually, he had to join Gamblers Anonymous. In the meantime, however, his tournament bridge career didn't suffer. He represented Britain six times on the European Championships, qualified to play in the Bermuda Bowl, and won all the major domestic events at least once.

A syndicate decided to open a new bridge club and Irving was persuaded to go and manage the club, since it was named after him - TGR - The Great Rose. Although he was no longer gambling, the late nights and stress of management led him to move to South Africa to recover his health.
