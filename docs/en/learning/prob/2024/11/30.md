On this deal, can you make the most of all your chances?

## The Auction

<table class="hand">
	<tr>
		<td>♠ AKQT987<br>♥ 2<br>♦ A3<br>♣ AK4</td>
	</tr>
</table>

On this deal, you are the dealer sitting South. Both sides are vulnerable. You have to decide what call to make in first position.

The hand has 20 high-card points plus 3 length points for a seven-
card spade suit. You have virtually ten tricks in your own hand, even if partner has nothing - seven spades, two clubs, and a diamond. That's much too strong to open with a non-forcing 1♠ bid. Instead, you can open a strong artificial 2♣ bid.

West passes, and partner, North, responds with a 2♦ artificial waiting bid. East passes, and the auction is back to you. What call will you make at this point?

With an unbalanced hand, it's time to show your spade suit. Since the strength of your hand is unlimited, the 2♠ rebid is forcing.

West passes, and partner bids 2NT. The popular modern style is that partner's 2NT bid shows some values and is forcing to at least game. With a weak hand, partner would make an artificial 3♣ rebid, cheaper minor negative, if that is the partnership agreement. What are you going to do now?

With partner showing some values, slam is a good possibility. As little as the ♦K and ♣Q would give you twelve top tricks. There might even be a grand slam if partner has the ♥A. However, a jump to 4NT here might not be interpreted as Blackwood by partner. With no suit agreed, it can be a quantitative raise, showing a relatively balanced hand and inviting slam. So it is clearer to simply set the trump suit first by rebidding the spades. Since partner's 2NT bid has already committed the partnership to at least game, you only need to bid 3♠.

So let's go with that. West passes, and partner raises to 4♠. East passes, and the auction is back to you.

Now that you have agreed on a trump suit, you can use the Blackwood convention. You want to find out if the partnership has all the aces so you can consider a grand slam.

After West passes, partner replies 5♣, showing no aces. (If the partnership plays key-card Blackwood, partner would make the reply showing no keycards - 5♣ if playing 30-14 responses or 5♦ playing 14-30 responses.) East passes, and you must decide what to do after this disappointing response.

With the partnership missing an ace, a grand slam is out of the picture. However, partner has some values, and you don't need much to have a good chance of making twelve tricks. So let's assume you bid a slam in spades.

Everyone passes, and you are now the declarer in 6♠.

Partner puts down a dummy with 10 high-card points, but you still have some work to do.

The first step in planning the play in a suit contract is to consider the number of losers you have. You don't have any losers in the trump suit. The spades are solid. You have a potential heart loser since you are missing the ♥A. You already knew that after partner's reply to the Blackwood convention. You also have a potential club loser since you are missing the ♣Q. You don't have any diamond losers since dummy's ♦K will take care of the low diamond in your hand. So you have two potential losers but can afford only one.

In hearts, you can't avoid a loser in the suit itself. The only way to avoid a heart loser is to create an extra winner in dummy on which to discard your singleton heart. You might be able to create an extra winner in clubs by establishing dummy's fourth club. Or you might be able to develop an extra diamond winner with the help of a finesse if West holds the ♦Q.

In clubs, you might be able to avoid a loser with the help of a finesse
if East holds the ♣Q. And if the defenders' clubs are divided 3-3, dummy's fourth club will become a winner on which you could discard your heart loser.

Another possibility for eliminating a club loser is to create an extra winner in dummy on which to discard the club loser. You might be able to create an extra heart winner in dummy with the help of a finesse if West holds the ♥A. Alternatively, you might be able to create an extra diamond winner in dummy with the help of a finesse if West holds the ♦Q.

So there are lots of possibilities for eliminating at least one of your losers. You have potential finesses in hearts, clubs, and diamonds. Which should you try?

Let's see how the play might start off.

## Possible Play

West has led a trump, the ♠2.

That doesn't help you much. You win the first trick in your hand. You might as well draw the defenders' remaining trumps. You have enough entries to both hands to take any of the finesses you might need. When you lead another round of trumps, both defenders follow suit. That takes care of the trump suit. What next?

It wouldn't be a good idea to stake everything on the diamond finesse at this point. If it loses, the contract will go down right away.

However, you can give yourself two chances by starting with the heart finesse. If West has the ♥A, you can establish dummy's ♥K as a winner on which to discard your club loser. If the heart loser doesn't work, you can still fall back on the club finesse.

Let's see what will happen on the actual deal. Suppose you lead a heart toward dummy and West plays a low heart. What should you play from dummy?

You were hoping West would play the ♥A, solving all your problems. West may still have the ♥A and have chosen not to play it. If you change your mind and now think West doesn't hold the ♥A, you could play low, hoping East holds a singleton ♥A or will perhaps win this trick with a low heart and then perhaps try to take a trick with the ♥A - which you will ruff. However, it's highly unlikely East has a singleton ♥A or will mis-defend if you just put East on lead. So you might as well go through with your original plan and try the ♥K.

As you might have expected, the heart finesse doesn't work. East captures dummy's ♥K with the ♥A. It was a good try, but it isn't going to work on this deal. East returns the ♥J and you have to ruff this trick. What next?

It won't do any harm to take a trick with the ♣A in case either defender holds the singleton ♣Q. However, only low clubs appear from both defenders.

You are at the critical point in the play. Suppose you think that the best chance now is the club finesse.

It won't do any harm to take the two top diamonds first, just in case the ♦Q falls. So let's suppose you play the ♦A and both defenders follow with low diamonds. You continue with your remaining low diamond to dummy's ♦K. The ♦Q still doesn't appear.

You now try your last chance. You lead the ♣J and East follows with a low club. You play a low club from your hand but, sadly, West wins the trick with the ♣Q.

You have the rest of the tricks, but 6♠ is down one.

That's a little unlucky. Playing this way, you gave yourself two chances. You would make the contract if either the heart finesse or the club finesse worked. That's a 75% chance.

When this actual deal was played, Giorgio Belladonna, a member of the famous Italian Blue team, was sitting South.

## The Actual Play

He and his partner were using rather complex bidding methods, but they arrived at the same 6♠ contract. Let's see how Belladonna, one of the world's best declarers, played this deal.

Giorgio Belladonna got the same opening lead of a low trump and won the first trick. He continued with a high spade, drawing the defenders' remaining trumps.

He then played the hand to give himself three good chances, rather than just two.

He started with his first chance, the heart finesse. He led a heart toward dummy's ♥K but, as you've seen, this first 50% chance didn't work. East won with the ♥A.

He ruffed the heart return. He then gave himself a second chance. He took a trick with the ♣A. Both defenders followed with low clubs.

Next, he continued with the ♣K!

By playing both the ♣A and ♣K, Belladonna was giving himself the chance that the ♣Q would fall singleton or doubleton. This gave him another nearly 20% chance.

However, the ♣Q didn't fall. Belladonna moved to his third chance. He took a trick with the ♦A. He continued with a low diamond and finessed dummy's ♦J. This finesse worked as East followed with a low diamond.

He played dummy's ♦K and discarded his club loser. He had the rest of the tricks with all the high trumps, making the small slam. All he lost was the ♥A.

## The Rest of the Story

Here's the full deal.

By playing as he did, Belladonna maximized the overall chance of making the contract. He had the chance that the heart finesse would work, the ♣Q would fall singleton or doubleton, or the diamond finesse would work. That improved the chance of making the contract to nearly 80%.

Technically, Belladonna's odds were even better than that. Before trying the final diamond finesse, he took all his spade winners. This gave him the extra chance that the player holding the ♦Q might also hold the ♣Q and be unable to hold both cards at the end - a "squeeze." However, the main point is that he gave himself every possible chance.

For a player of Giorgio Belladonna's ability, the play on a deal like this is fairly routine, making the most of the various chances.

Belladonna was an Italian player who won sixteen world championship titles with the famous Squadra Azzura - Blue Team - playing with Walter Avarelli from 1956 to 1969 and later with Benito Garozzo.

The Italian Blue Team won ten consecutive Bermuda Bowl championships along with three consecutive World Team Olympiads over the same period. Belladonna was the only player who played in every one of those championships, and he continued to win three more Bermuda Bowls after most of the Blue Team disbanded. At the time, he was the leading winner of World Bridge Federation points and was considered by many to be the world's best player.

Apart from playing in formal tournaments, Belladonna also played with the Omar Sharif Bridge Circus, playing exhibition matches in Europe and throughout the United States. The tours culminated in a high stakes rubber bridge challenge match in London in 1970 against Jeremy Flint and Jonathan Cansino. The Circus won by over 5,000 points.
