## The Auction

<table class="hand">
	<tr>
		<td>♠ K642<br>♥ K6<br>♦ 54<br>♣ 97643</td>
	</tr>
</table>

Suppose you are sitting South. The opponents are vulnerable and your side is not. East is the dealer and opens 1♥. You have your first opportunity to make a call.

With only 6 high-card points plus 1 length point for a five-card club suit, you have no reason to come into the auction. You pass.

West responds 2♦. You partner, North, passes, and East raises to 3♦. The auction is back to you.

Naturally, you pass again.

West jumps to 4NT, the Blackwood convention. Partner passes again, and East replies 5♦, showing one ace. You have another chance to make a call.

You have nothing to say.

West now bids 6♦. Partner and East both pass. You have one last chance to make a call.

Naturally, you pass, ending the auction.

Partner will now be making the opening lead against West's 6♦ slam.

A low diamond is played from dummy, you play a low diamond, and declarer wins the trick with the ♦J. Declarer leads a low spade, partner plays a low spade, and declarer takes a finesse by playing dummy's ♠J. You are at a critical point in the defense. What's your plan for defeating the contract?

You have a trick with the ♠K. What could you do next?

Declarer presumably has the ♥A, so it would be dangerous to lead a heart.

Perhaps the best thing is to continue with another diamond, cutting down the number of times declarer can ruff any club losers in dummy.

So let's assume you win this trick with the ♠K. You lead a diamond, and declarer wins this trick in dummy as partner follows with the ♦9. Declarer takes a trick with dummy's ♠A, and everyone follows suit. Declarer continues with dummy's ♠Q. You follow with a low spade, declarer discards a heart, and partner's ♠10 falls on this trick. Since the ♠10 has fallen, dummy's ♠9 is now a winner. Declarer takes a trick with the ♠9, and both declarer and partner discard clubs on this trick. Partner obviously doesn't have any trumps remaining.

Declarer leads a low heart from dummy, you play low, and declarer wins the ♥A as partner follows with a low heart. It wouldn't have done any good for you to lead a heart earlier. Declarer had the ♥A. Declarer leads a club and ruffs in dummy. Another heart is led from dummy, and you have to play your ♥K as declarer ruffs with a diamond. Dummy's ♥Q is now a winner. Declarer ruffs another club in dummy. On the ♥Q, declarer discards a club.

Declarer takes the last two tricks with high trumps. Declarer has made the 6♦ slam, losing only a spade.

This deal comes from the final round of the International Olympic Committee Grand Prix in 2000. Sitting South was Norberto Bocchi of Italy, playing with Lorenzo Lauria. Their opponents were from Indonesia.

Let's see how Bocchi defended the contract.

## The Actual Defense

The play started the same way. Lauria, North, led the ♦2 at trick one, and declarer won with the ♦J. At trick two, declarer led a low spade and finessed dummy's ♠J. But here, Bocchi made a critical play.

Bocchi smoothly played a low spade!

At this point, declarer was convinced that North held the ♠K and the spade finesse was working.

Let's look at the remaining cards. Here are the remaining cards.

<table class="deal">
	<tr>
		<td></td>
		<td>♠ T7<br>♥ J985<br>♦ 9<br>♣ AJT5</td>
		<td></td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>♠ 8<br>♥ AT<br>♦ AK63<br>♣ KQ82</td>
		<td><pre>   N<br>W     E<br>   S</pre></td>
		<td>♠ AQ9<br>♥ Q7432<br>♦ QT8<br>♣ </td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td></td>
		<td>♠ K64<br>♥ K6<br>♦ 5<br>♣ 97643</td>
		<td></td>
	</tr>

When the spade finesse appeared to have worked, the Indonesian declarer figured he had an easy way to make twelve tricks by establishing a heart winner in dummy on which to discard one club, ruffing two clubs in dummy, and discarding one club on dummy's extra spade winner.

Let's see what happened. Declarer played a low heart from dummy to the ♥A. He then played a heart to dummy's ♥Q, losing to Bocchi's ♥K. That was okay for declarer. The defenders' hearts were dividing no worse than 4-2, and a heart winner could be established in dummy.

Bocchi led another trump, and declarer won in dummy. All the defenders' trumps were gone. Declarer ruffed a heart. Bocchi showed out, discarding a club, but that looked fine. Dummy's last heart could be established as a winner. Declarer ruffed a club in dummy. Declarer ruffed another heart, establishing dummy's remaining heart as a winner.

Next, declarer took another spade finesse, expecting it to win. Declarer was hoping to discard one of the remaining club losers on dummy's ♠A, another on dummy's established heart winner, and he could then ruff the last club with dummy's remaining trump. Imagine declarer's surprise when the spade finesse lost to Bocchi's ♠K!

6♦ was down one. Declarer had lost a heart trick and a spade trick.

When this deal was played at the other table, where Indonesia held the North-South cards and Italy held the East-West cards, the Italian pair also reached the 6♦ slam. However, when declarer took the spade finesse, the Indonesian defender sitting South won the ♠K. Declarer could no longer afford to lose a heart trick and subsequently discarded the ♥10 on dummy's extra spade winner. When the ♥K fell on the second round of the suit, the Italian declarer was able to establish the heart suit and use it to eliminate all the club losers.

The commentators watching the play discussed what would happen if South didn't win the ♠K right away, giving declarer a losing option. However, the commentators felt that holding up winning the ♠K was "an impossible play to find!" Apparently, it wasn't an impossible play for Bocchi!

By making the slam at one table and defeating it at the other table, the Italians won 16 IMPs and went into the lead by 11 IMPs. However, the Indonesian team fought back and regained the lead by 1 IMP a little later. When the match was over, Indonesia had upset the strong Italian team and won the championship.

Norberto Bocchi, born in Parma, Italy, played table tennis and basketball as a young man. At age 13, he started caddying at the bridge club where his father, Aldo, played. He earned about two Euros a session but supplemented his income by selling autographs he got his sister, Mabel, a famous basketball player, to sign. He listened to conversations at the bridge table and became familiar with a number of card games.

By age 17, he started to learn bridge and never looked back. By age 19, he had given up school and started playing with a professional partner, Arturo Franco. He joined the Lavazza team early on - a team sponsored by Maria Teresa Lavazza, an owner of the Lavazza coffee company - and played with that team for 40 years.

Norberto Bocchi has won five World Team Championships along with six consecutive European team Championships, plus a seventh in 2010.
