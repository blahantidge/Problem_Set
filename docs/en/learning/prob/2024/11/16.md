On this deal, you have to watch out for the opponents.

## The Auction

<table class="hand">
	<tr>
		<td>♠ QJ8753<br>♥ 8<br>♦ AQT<br>♣ T65</td>
	</tr>
</table>

On this deal, sitting South was movie icon Omar Sharif.

Both sides were vulnerable. West was the dealer and opened 1♣. North passed and East responded 1♥. Sharif had to decide what to do with the South hand.

With 9 high-card points plus 2 length points for a six-card spade suit, Sharif had a normal overcall of 1♠.

West raised responder's suit to 2♥. Sharif's partner competed to 2♠. East then jumped to 4♥. Sharif had to decide what to do after this development.

This is a typical competitive situation. Should South pass and defend, perhaps hoping to defeat 4♥? Or should South compete to 4♠, perhaps hoping to make the contract or, more likely, that 4♠ is a good sacrifice against 4♥ or that it will push the opponents to 5♥?

Despite being vulnerable, Sharif chose to bid 4♠. After all, the opponents were also vulnerable, so going down two tricks would be okay if 4♥ was making. Let's go with Sharif's choice.

West and partner both passed. Unsurprisingly, East chose to double for penalty rather than bid on. Sharif had another call.

Naturally, Sharif passed.

West and North also passed, ending the auction. Sharif was the declarer in 4♠ doubled with West on lead.

## Planning the Play

Before we see how Omar Sharif handled the play, let's take a look at what you would do as declarer in the South position.

West leads the ♠2, and partner puts down the dummy.

<table class="deal">
	<tr>
		<td></td>
		<td>♠ KT9<br>♥ J94<br>♦ 85<br>♣ AJ974</td>
		<td></td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>♠ <br>♥ <br>♦ <br>♣ </td>
		<td><pre>   N<br>W     E<br>   S</pre></td>
		<td>♠ <br>♥ <br>♦ <br>♣ </td>

	</tr>
</table>

That's a good dummy. Perhaps you have a chance of making the contract.

As declarer, your focus is on taking ten tricks, and you start by considering the potential losers in 4♠. There is one sure spade loser, the ♠A. You can't get around that. However, the rest of the spades are solid. There's one heart loser. The opponents have the high hearts, but you can ruff the second round. There are two potential club losers since you are missing both the ♣K and ♣Q. There are also two potential diamond losers since the opponents hold the ♦K and ♦J. So that's a total of six potential losers. You will need to eliminate three of them if you are to make the doubled contract.

You can't do anything about the spade and heart losers.

In clubs, however, you can hope to lose only one trick with the help of repeated finesses. You can plan to lead the and take a finesse if West plays low. If that loses to the ♣K and ♣Q, you can plan to repeat the finesse by leading a club to dummy's ♣J or ♣9 after regaining the lead. Playing clubs this way, you will lose only one trick if West holds the ♣K, or ♣Q, or both the ♣K and ♣Q. Only if East holds both the ♣K and ♣Q will you lose two tricks. That's a 75% chance. On this deal, the odds are much better than that since West opened 1♣ and is likely to have at least one of the club honors.

You can avoid a diamond loser if East has at least one of the missing diamond honors by also using a repeated finesse. You could lead a diamond from dummy and finesse the ♦10. If this loses to the ♦J, you can lead another diamond from dummy and finesse the ♦Q. Like the clubs, that's a 75% chance of avoiding at least one loser. A better plan, however, is to simply finesse the ♦Q. If East holds the ♦K, the finesse will work and you can then ruff your third diamond in dummy. That gives you a 50% chance of losing no diamond tricks.

So it looks as though you can make the contract if East holds the ♦K and West holds at least one of the club honors.

Let's see how the play might start off.

## Possible Play

West has led the ♠2. You play the ♠9 from dummy, and it wins the first trick as East follows with a low spade. Apparently, one of the defenders, likely East, is holding up winning the ♠A.

The entry to dummy gives you the opportunity to try the diamond finesse. You want to take it before the defenders can remove dummy's spades. You play a diamond from dummy and finesse the ♦Q. It wins. Good start! You take a trick with the ♦A. Both defenders follow with low diamonds. You lead your third diamond and ruff it in the dummy. Both defenders follow suit. You've eliminated the diamond loser.

Now you are at the critical point in the play. If West has one of the club honors, you should only have to lose one club trick to go with the heart and spade losers. So all you need is to draw the remaining trumps and try the clubs.

But let's see what will happen if you lead the ♠K at this point. Suppose you play the ♠K. East wins the ♠A as West shows out. East still has a low spade remaining.

East switches to a club. That looks helpful since you now won't need to take the repeated finesse in clubs. You play low, West plays the and you win dummy's ♣A. It looks as though you are going to have only one club loser. There's a problem, however. You need to get back to your hand to draw East's last trump. You don't want to lead a club, since East will probably be able to ruff a club.

So let's suppose you lead a heart. You will be able to ruff a second round of hearts and draw the last trump. East plays a low heart, however, and West wins the trick. West takes the ♣K as East shows out. West now leads another club and East ruffs with the outstanding trump. Too bad.

You have the rest of the tricks, but 4♠ doubled is down one. The defenders got a spade, a heart, a club, and a club ruff.

Could the contract have been made?

Let's see how Omar Sharif handled the play.

## The Actual Play

Omar Sharif got the same opening lead of a spade and dummy won the first trick. He finessed the ♦Q, which worked. He took a trick with the ♦A. He ruffed the third diamond in dummy.

At this point, Sharif considered what was likely to happen if he led the ♠K. As you have seen, he would then be unable to prevent East from getting a club ruff. So he found a solution.

He led a heart from dummy!

He wanted to break up the defenders' communication.

West won the trick, although it didn't matter which defender won at this point. West led the and Sharif won dummy's ♣A.

Sharif was fairly certain from the auction and the early play that East held at most one club. He then led the ♠K from dummy. East won the as West showed out. East tried to get to West's hand with a heart trick but, thanks to Sharif's earlier heart play, the communication was cut and he could ruff this trick.

He drew East's last trump. He could safely drive out West's other high club.

He had the rest of the tricks, making the doubled contract. He had lost only one spade, one heart, and one club, but no club ruff.

The play that Sharif used to make the contract is called a scissors coup. It is aptly named that because it "cuts" the communication between the defenders. The other declarers in the event who reached the same contract failed to find he necessary coup.

Omar Sharif was born Michel Dimitri Chalboub in Alexandria, Egypt, in 1932. He began his career as an actor in Egypt but is best known for his appearances in British and American productions such as Lawrence of Arabia, Doctor Zhivago, and Funny Girl. He spoke Arabic, English, Greek, French, Spanish, and Italian fluently. During the dictatorship of Gamal Abdel Nasser, he went into self-exile in Europe.

In addition to being a regular in the French casinos, he started playing bridge seriously. He became ranked among the world's top 50 players and played in an exhibition match before the Shah of Iran. Working with Charles Goren, Sharif co-wrote a syndicated bridge column for the Chicago Tribune newspaper for several years. He also co-authored several bridge books and licensed his name to a bridge video game, Omar Sharif on Bridge, which Computer Gaming World named as one of the year's best strategy games in 1992.

Despite his success in films, Sharif once stated, "Acting is my business, but bridge is my passion." He represented the United Arab Republic in the 1963 World Team Olympiad and was the playing captain of the Egyptian team in the 1968 World Olympiad. Asked why he spent so much time playing bridge when he could be making movies, he replied, "The real question is why I spend so much time making movies when I could be playing bridge."

In 1967, Sharif organized the Omar Sharif Bridge Circus to showcase the game. This was a traveling tour of bridge players that promoted the game via exhibition matches. The team included top French and Italian players and toured North America in 1970. It played a number of matches against the Dallas Aces team.
