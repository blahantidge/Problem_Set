On this deal, what can you do if you can't prevent the defenders from getting a ruff?

<Badge type="warning" text="Play"/>

## The Auction

<table class="hand">
	<tr>
		<td>♠ AK6<br>♥ JT93<br>♦ AT95<br>♣ K3</td>
	</tr>
</table>

Suppose you are the dealer sitting South, with both sides vulnerable. You have to choose an opening call in first position.

With 15 high-card points and a balanced distribution, the hand is ideal for a 1NT opening bid.

West passes, and partner, North, responds 2♣, the Stayman convention. East passes, and the auction is back to you.

Partner's 2♣ bid asks if you have a four-card major suit. You reply 2♥, showing the heart suit.

West passes, and partner raises right to 4♥. East passes, and you have another call to make.

Partner's raise to 4♥ shows four-card or longer support for hearts and enough strength to take the partnership to game. You have nothing further to say. You pass.

West also passes, and the auction is over. You are now the declarer in 4♥ with West on lead.

## Planning the Play

West leads the ♠9, and partner puts down the dummy.

<table class="deal">
	<tr>
		<td></td>
		<td>♠ Q842<br>♥ Q542<br>♦ QJ<br>♣ A2</td>
		<td></td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>♠ <br>♥ <br>♦ <br>♣ </td>
		<td><pre>   N<br>W     E<br>   S</pre></td>
		<td>♠ <br>♥ <br>♦ <br>♣ </td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td></td>
		<td>♠ AK6<br>♥ JT93<br>♦ AT95<br>♣ K3</td>
		<td></td>
	</tr>
</table>

The first step in declarer's plan is to consider the possible losers. There are two sure heart losers since the opponents hold both the ♥A and ♥K. There are no spade losers. You have the ♠A-K and dummy has the ♠Q. There is a potential diamond loser since you are missing the ♦K. Finally, there are no club losers since dummy's ♣A will take care of the low club in your hand. So there appear to be only three potential losers, two hearts and a diamond.

There's nothing that can be done about the two heart losers, but you may be able to avoid the diamond loser with the help of a finesse if East holds the ♦K.

With only three apparent losers, the deal looks quite straightforward. In fact, it appears there is even an opportunity to make an overtrick if the diamond finesse works. Is there any potential problem?

West has led the ♠9. Looking at the ♠8 in dummy, it's likely West is leading a singleton or perhaps top of a doubleton. So the defenders may be able to get a spade ruff. That will give you a fourth potential loser. Is there any way to prevent the defenders from getting a spade ruff?

Let's see how the play might start off.

## Possible Play

West has led the ♠9. Let's suppose you win this in your hand with the ♠K. What now?

To try to prevent the defenders from ruffing your winners, the usual plan is to draw the defenders' trumps as quickly as possible.

Let's see whether that will work on this deal. Suppose you lead a low heart to dummy's ♥Q at trick two. East wins the ♥A.

East returns a spade. You'll still be okay if West started with a doubleton spade. You don't want to risk getting your ruffed, so you play low from your hand. If West started with a doubleton and follows to this trick, you will win it in dummy. However, West ruffs this trick with a low heart. As you suspected, West did start with a singleton spade. At least, West ruffed low spades and you still have the and ♠A and ♠Q for later. West takes a trick with the ♥K. East follows to this trick, so at least the defenders have no hearts remaining. However, you have already lost three tricks. West leads a club. Since you'll still be okay if the diamond finesse works, you win this trick with dummy's ♣A.

You lead the ♦Q from dummy. When East follows with a low diamond, you play low, taking the finesse. Unfortunately, West wins the ♦K.

You have the rest of the tricks, but 4♥ is down one.

It's too bad the diamond finesse lost and the defenders were able to get a spade ruff.

This was an actual deal from the 1989 European Championships. Sitting South was Tony Forrester, playing for England. His partner was Raymond Brock. Let's see how Forrester played the contract.

## The Actual Play

Against Tony Forrester's 4♥ contract, West also led a spade. Forrester won the first trick.

Forrester was aware that the spade lead could be a singleton or top of a doubleton. What could he do to prevent the defenders from getting a ruff when they gained the lead in the trump suit?

Nothing!

Since the opponents held both the ♥A and ♥K, East was almost certainly going to be able to win one of the heart tricks and give West a spade ruff.

Having decided he couldn't prevent that, he considered what he could do if West held the ♦K. Instead of immediately leading a heart, Forrester first took a trick with the ♣K. He then played a club to dummy's ♣A. He led dummy's last club and ruffed it in his hand. He had eliminated the clubs in the combined hands, making it unsafe for the defenders to lead a club on gaining the lead. That would give him a ruff and a sluff, allowing him to discard a diamond from dummy. Next, he led a heart. East won the ♥A.

East led a spade, and West ruffed the trick, as Forrester expected. West took a trick with the ♥K. That was the third trick for the defense. However, what could West do?

West was endplayed. If West led a club, declarer could discard a diamond from dummy and ruff in his hand. Declarer would then have no diamond trick to lose. So West led a diamond. It didn't matter which defender held the ♦K. Forrester played the ♦J from dummy, which won the trick.

Forrester had the rest of the tricks. He had lost two heart tricks and a spade ruff, but no diamond trick.

Forrester's play on this deal is an illustration of how the expert thinks ahead. Seeing he wouldn't be able to prevent West from getting a spade ruff, Forrester visualized what the situation would be after West ruffed the spade. By eliminating West's option of exiting safely with a club, he gave the defenders no winning option. On gaining the lead, East could give partner a ruff or lead a diamond, but East couldn't do both.

Anthony R. (Tony) Forrester was brought up in West Yorkshire. Although his parents were keen bridge players, they wanted him to focus on his studies. However, when he showed little interest in academic life, they decided to teach him the game. He started playing in local competitions with his father at age 17. Forrester's first big win with his father came when he was 18. He went on to accumulate cups and trophies at a fearsome rate during the 70s and 80s.

He was working as a finance director during the week - earning a "proper living" as his dad would call it - while playing bridge about 40 weekends a year. Having established a name for himself in bridge, he became a full-time columnist for both the Daily Telegraph and the Sunday Telegraph - seven days a week.

As Forrester comments:

"Trying to think of seven hands a week is a much more difficult assignment than coming up with one. It becomes more of an art form."

"In one simple column, you can make up to 300 or 400 mistakes, so I have to check every single card and make sure the bidding is completely accurate."

"It takes a lot of care and attention, which is the boring side - the artistic bit is much more interesting."

Forrester is England's most capped player, having played 43 times in the Camrose Trophy. In 2015, he was one of the first two winners of the British Bridge Union's Diamond Award, introduced to recognize players who have "represented England - and earlier Great Britain - with distinction over a long period."
