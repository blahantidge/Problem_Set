On this deal, you have the right plan but is that enough?

<Badge type="warning" text="Play"/>

## The Auction

<table class="hand">
	<tr>
		<td>♠ AQ9872<br>♥ K743<br>♦ AK2<br>♣ </td>
	</tr>
</table>

Suppose you are the dealer sitting South. Your side is vulnerable and the opponents are not. You have to choose a call in first position.

You have 16 high-card points plus 2 length points for the six-card spade suit. That's more than enough to open the bidding. You start by bidding your long major suit.

West overcalls 2♥. Your partner, North, raises to 2♠, and East passes. The auction is back to you.

The ♥K has gone down in value with the heart overcall on your left. With four hearts, however, it is likely partner is short in hearts and some of the heart losers can be ruffed in dummy. Partner has shown spade support, so the sixth spade, ♦A-K, and club void are all encouraging factors. With no obvious game try to make, let's assume you simply jump to 4♠.

Everyone passes, and you are now the declarer in 4♠ with West on lead.

<table class="auction">
	<tr>
		<th>North</th>

		<th>South</th>
		<th>West</th>
	</tr>
	<tr>

		<td>1♠</td>

		<td>4♠</td>
		<td>Pass</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>

## Planning the Play

West leads the ♦10, and partner puts down the dummy.

<table class="deal">
	<tr>
		<td></td>
		<td>♠ JT5<br>♥ 6<br>♦ 643<br>♣ KJ8732</td>
		<td></td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>♠ <br>♥ <br>♦ <br>♣ </td>
		<td><pre>   N<br>W     E<br>   S</pre></td>
		<td>♠ <br>♥ <br>♦ <br>♣ </td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td></td>
		<td>♠ AQ9872<br>♥ K743<br>♦ AK2<br>♣ </td>
		<td></td>
	</tr>
</table>

In planning the play, start by considering the potential losers. There's one potential spade loser since the ♠K is missing. There are four potential heart losers since the opponents have all the high hearts other than the ♥K. There are no club losers, but there will be a potential diamond loser left after the ♦A and ♦K are gone. That's a total of six potential losers: a spade, four hearts, and a diamond. You need to eliminate three of them.

The spade loser might be avoided with the help of a finesse if East holds the ♠K. That's basically a 50% chance although West did overcall during the auction and is a favorite to hold most of the missing high cards.

A heart loser might also be avoided with the help of a finesse by leading toward the ♥K, hoping East holds the ♥A. Again, that would be a 50% chance in isolation, but it is much less likely on this deal after West's heart overcall.

A more practical idea is to plan to ruff heart losers in dummy after giving up a heart trick. Provided the defenders don't lead trumps, you will be able to ruff three losers in dummy. It won't matter if East can overruff the last heart with the ♠K since you can afford a spade loser. If the defenders do lead a spade, it looks as though you will need the spade finesse to work.

So the basic plan is to try to ruff three hearts in dummy, losing only one heart, one spade, and one diamond. Is there anything else you need to do?

Let's see how the play might start off.

## Possible Play

West has led the ♦10. A low diamond is played from dummy and East plays the ♦7. You don't want to hold up winning this trick and give the opponents an opportunity to lead a spade, so you win the ♦K. You are now at the critical point in the play. What are you doing next?

The plan is to give up a heart trick and try to ruff heart losers in dummy.

Let's see what will happen if you play a low heart at trick two. Suppose you lead a low heart. West plays the ♥9, you play low from dummy, and East overtakes with the ♥10. You are now ready to ruff heart losers in dummy.

East can see what you are planning to do, however, and shifts to a low spade. Should you try the spade finesse or win the ♠A?

If you try the spade finesse and it loses, West will lead a second spade and you will get to ruff only one heart loser. So let's see what will happen if you win the ♠A.

Suppose you play the ♠A. West follows with a low spade. Too bad West didn't have a singleton ♠K. Now you can ruff a heart loser in dummy. You get back to your hand by ruffing a club. You ruff another heart loser in dummy. It would be nice if the ♥A appeared on this trick, but East follows with a low heart. You get back to your hand with the ♦A, or by ruffing a club.

However, you are still left with a spade loser, a second heart loser, and a diamond loser. 4♠ is down one.

Perhaps it was necessary to try the spade finesse. Let's go back and see.

## Another Possible Play

West leads the ♦10 and you win the first trick. You give up a heart trick, and East wins. East now shifts to a spade.

You've seen what will happen if you win the ♠A. You won't have enough tricks even after ruffing two hearts in dummy. So let's try the spade finesse.

Suppose you play a low spade. Unfortunately, the finesse loses as West wins the ♠K. Worse, West leads another spade. Not only have you lost a spade trick, you are left with only one spade to ruff heart losers.

You're going down two tricks, losing a spade, three hearts, and a diamond.

With West holding the ♠K, it looks as though you have your choice of going down one or down two.

When this actual hand was played, sitting South as declarer was Buster Keaton. His opponents were the husband-and-wife pair of Alfred Sheinwold and Patricia Fox Sheinwold. Let's see how Keaton handled the play.

## The Actual Play

Alfred Sheinwold led the ♦10. A low diamond was played from dummy, East played the ♦7, and Keaton won the ♦K.

At almost the same time, he played a card to the next trick!

The ♥K almost simultaneously hit the table!

Had he made a mistake, playing both red kings at once?

Let's see. Here are the remaining cards.

<table class="deal">
	<tr>
		<td></td>
		<td>♠ JT5<br>♥ 6<br>♦ 64<br>♣ KJ8732</td>
		<td></td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>♠ K3<br>♥ AQJ95<br>♦ 98<br>♣ AQ4</td>
		<td><pre>   N<br>W     E<br>   S</pre></td>
		<td>♠ 64<br>♥ T82<br>♦ QJ5<br>♣ T965</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td></td>
		<td>♠ AQ9872<br>♥ K743<br>♦ A2<br>♣ </td>
		<td></td>
	</tr>
</table>

Sheinwold won the trick with the ♥A. But what could Sheinwold do?

If Sheinwold led a spade away from his doubleton ♠K, he would be giving up his potential spade winner. The best Sheinwold could do was continue with another diamond.

Keaton won with the ♦A. Keaton could then ruff a heart loser in dummy. He ruffed a club to get back to his hand. Another heart loser was ruffed in dummy. Back to his hand with another club ruff. The last heart was ruffed in dummy. East couldn't overruff dummy's ♠J. However, even if East did have the ♠K, it wouldn't matter if East overruffed. That was a trick Keaton was planning to lose anyway.

Keaton got back to his hand with another club ruff. The drew low spades from both defenders. He still had to lose a trick to the ♠K. His last spade was a winner.

There was still a diamond loser, but 4♠ was made. Keaton had lost only one spade, one diamond, and one heart trick.

## The Rest of the Story

Keaton's play of the ♥K to the second trick was well thought out. It was virtually certain that West held the ♥A. By leading the ♥K instead of a low heart, he put the safe opponent, West, on lead. West couldn't effectively lead a spade.

Alfred Sheinwold was impressed by how quickly Keaton worked out to win the ♥K and lead the ♥K. Keaton was known for his quick actions in the many stunts he performed in his early silent movies. However, Keaton was also an excellent bridge player.

The first time Keaton played bridge was on a cross-country train trip. Unfortunately, his partner was very insulting about his inexperience. That set Keaton on a path to read books on bridge and practice until he became highly adept. He then had the satisfaction of beating his original partner soundly in a rematch.

Keaton became known as one of the best and most devoted bridge players in Hollywood. A young dancer at MGM, Eleanor Norris, wanted to learn the game and was introduced to Keaton by a mutual friend. Eleanor was impressed by Keaton's gentleness and patience as a teacher, and she started getting baseball lessons from him as well. Keaton was an even bigger fan of baseball than bridge.

After Eleanor stood up for herself when a partner chewed her out for a mistake at the bridge table, Keaton was impressed with her spunk and the two started dating. They were married shortly thereafter.
