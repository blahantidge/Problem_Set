Today's column looks at inviting game after responder raises opener's major suit.

<Badge type="danger" text="Bid"/>

## Introduction

### Responder's Simple Raise

Responder's raise of a 1♥ or 1♠ opening bid to the two level is a 'simple raise.' A simple raise of opener's major suit shows about 6-10 points, counting dummy points, and at least three-card support for opener's major.

A simple raise establishes Where the partnership belongs, and opener often also knows How High.

With a minimum hand of about 12-15 points, opener knows the partnership belongs in partscore and will pass. With a maximum hand of 19-21 points, opener can bid game. With a medium hand of about 16-18 points, opener can invite game, in a number of ways.

### Trying for Game

There are lots of agreements a partnership can make about how to try for game after a simple raise of opener's major. This column assumes standard methods: a new suit is natural, showing length and some strength in the suit, and a re-raise to three of the major is a straightforward invitation to game.

Let's look at some hands, first from opener's perspective.

Suppose South holds this hand and opens the bidding 1♥.

<table class="hand">
	<tr>
		<td>♠ A4<br>♥ KQJ93<br>♦ AJ82<br>♣ J4</td>
	</tr>
</table>

North raises to 2♥, and South has to consider whether to move toward game and, if so, how.

<table class="auction">
	<tr>
		<th>North</th>
		<th>East</th>
		<th>South</th>
		<th>West</th>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td></td>
		<td></td>
		<td>1♥</td>
		<td>Pass</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>2♥</td>
		<td>Pass</td>
		<td>?</td>
		<td></td>
	</tr>
</table>

South has enough strength to invite game, with 16 high-card points, plus 1 length point for the five-card heart suit. The most descriptive call South can make is 3♦, showing length and strength in diamonds. The 3♦ bid will help North evaluate game prospects. With a borderline hand, North will value diamond honors more highly than spade or club honors.

How about when opener lacks a four-card side suit?

Consider this hand.

<table class="hand">
	<tr>
		<td>♠ AQJ732<br>♥ KT4<br>♦ Q9<br>♣ K6</td>
	</tr>
</table>

South has 15 high-card points, plus 2 length points for the six-card spade suit. When North raises to 2♠, South has enough strength to invite game.

<table class="auction">
	<tr>
		<th>North</th>
		<th>East</th>
		<th>South</th>
		<th>West</th>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td></td>
		<td></td>
		<td>1♠</td>
		<td>Pass</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>2♠</td>
		<td>Pass</td>
		<td>?</td>
		<td></td>
	</tr>
</table>

Making a game try by bidding a three-card suit is not out of the question, but it doesn't look like the best call with this hand. South does not want to emphasize any suit. Honors will be valuable no matter where they lie. South needs help in all the side suits. Rather than bid a new suit, South can bid 3♠ as a general game try when that is the partnership agreement.

Let's take a look at a different hand for opener.

<table class="hand">
	<tr>
		<td>♠ KT832<br>♥ K4<br>♦ 73<br>♣ AKT2</td>
	</tr>
</table>

South holds this hand and opens the bidding 1♠. With the opponents passing, North raises to 2♠.

<table class="auction">
	<tr>
		<th>North</th>
		<th>East</th>
		<th>South</th>
		<th>West</th>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td></td>
		<td></td>
		<td>1♠</td>
		<td>Pass</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>2♠</td>
		<td>Pass</td>
		<td>?</td>
		<td></td>
	</tr>
</table>

The clubs are strong, but it is important for South to resist the temptation to bid 3♣. South has only 13 high-card points plus 1 length point for the five-card spade suit. Even if North has 10 points - the maximum for a simple raise to 2♠ - North-South will still have too little combined strength for game. Pass is the correct call. 3♠ would show a stronger hand.

Now for the other end of the spectrum. Suppose South holds this hand.

<table class="hand">
	<tr>
		<td>♠ K873<br>♥ AQJT52<br>♦ A<br>♣ K6</td>
	</tr>
</table>

South opens the bidding 1♥, and North makes a simple raise to 2♥.

<table class="auction">
	<tr>
		<th>North</th>
		<th>East</th>
		<th>South</th>
		<th>West</th>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td></td>
		<td></td>
		<td>1♥</td>
		<td>Pass</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>2♥</td>
		<td>Pass</td>
		<td>?</td>
		<td></td>
	</tr>
</table>

With 19 points - 17 high-card points plus 2 length points for the six-card heart suit - South knows the partnership has enough combined strength for a game contract. There is no need to make a game try by bidding spades. Unless South wants to look for a slam - unlikely with at most 29 combined points - it is better to just jump to 4♥ and not give East-West any further information about opener's hand.

Usually, when opener has the strength to invite game opposite a simple raise, there will be one call that stands out, relative to other options. Sometimes, however, things are less clear.

Consider this hand for South, with 15 high-card points plus 1 length point for the five-card spade suit.

<table class="hand">
	<tr>
		<td>♠ AQ743<br>♥ AT93<br>♦ AJ5<br>♣ 8</td>
	</tr>
</table>

<table class="auction">
	<tr>
		<th>North</th>
		<th>East</th>
		<th>South</th>
		<th>West</th>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td></td>
		<td></td>
		<td>1♠</td>
		<td>Pass</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>2♠</td>
		<td>Pass</td>
		<td>?</td>
		<td></td>
	</tr>
</table>

Ordinarily, South bids the longest side suit when trying for game. Over a 3♥ bid, North will either sign off in 3♠ or commit the partnership to game. If North signs off in 3♠, South will have to pass, lacking the strength for 4♠ opposite a minimum for responder. If North's high-cards are in clubs, that decision will likely be correct, but what if North has diamond honors?

Diamond honors will fit well with opener's hand, but North will not know that if South bids 3♥. It may be better to bid 3♦. If North bids 4♠, South will be happy. If North cannot commit to game, North may be able to rebid 3♥ showing strength in hearts and keeping game chances alive but the partnership can still stop in 3♠.

3♥ is a perfectly acceptable call, but 3♦ is more flexible.

### The Other Side of the Table

Let's move to the other side of the table and look at things from responder's point of view. After making a simple raise of opener's major suit and hearing opener make a game try, how should responder proceed?

Opener is typically looking for help in the side suit and responder can upgrade honors in the suit - or shortness since opener can then ruff losers in the side suit in dummy.

Consider this hand.

<table class="hand">
	<tr>
		<td>♠ K832<br>♥ J94<br>♦ 54<br>♣ AT92</td>
	</tr>
</table>

South has 8 high-card points plus 1 dummy point for the doubleton diamond.

<table class="auction">
	<tr>
		<th>North</th>
		<th>East</th>
		<th>South</th>
		<th>West</th>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>1♥</td>
		<td>Pass</td>
		<td>2♥</td>
		<td>Pass</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>3♣</td>
		<td>Pass</td>
		<td>?</td>
		<td></td>
	</tr>
</table>

Responder will usually accept any game invitation with most 9- or 10-point hands. Here, South's strong club holding only makes it easier to bid 4♥ over 3♣, accepting the invitation.

Let's give South a slightly weaker hand.

<table class="hand">
	<tr>
		<td>♠ Q96<br>♥ 542<br>♦ KQT4<br>♣ 863</td>
	</tr>
</table>

North opens the bidding 1♠, South makes a simple raise to 2♠, and North invites game by bidding 3♦.

<table class="auction">
	<tr>
		<th>North</th>
		<th>East</th>
		<th>South</th>
		<th>West</th>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>1♠</td>
		<td>Pass</td>
		<td>2♠</td>
		<td>Pass</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>3♦</td>
		<td>Pass</td>
		<td>?</td>
		<td></td>
	</tr>
</table>

South has only 7 points, but all of the high-cards are in the suits North has bid. North's 3♦ bid suggests South value diamond honors more highly than other high-cards. 4♠ is likely to be a good contract, so responder accepts the invitation by jumping to game.

Here is another 7-point hand for South.

<table class="hand">
	<tr>
		<td>♠ KJ4<br>♥ T73<br>♦ J85<br>♣ Q982</td>
	</tr>
</table>

North opens the bidding 1♥, South makes a simple raise to 2♥, and North bids 3♦.

<table class="auction">
	<tr>
		<th>North</th>
		<th>East</th>
		<th>South</th>
		<th>West</th>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>1♥</td>
		<td>Pass</td>
		<td>2♥</td>
		<td>Pass</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>3♦</td>
		<td>Pass</td>
		<td>?</td>
		<td></td>
	</tr>
</table>

With a near-minimum for the raise to 2♥, South will normally sign off in 3♥ over a game try by North. An exception can be made with all of South's values concentrated in North's suits, but with this hand, it is clear to go back to 3♥, rejecting the invitation. South has weak holdings in hearts and diamonds, and the spade and club honors may not be very useful. Hope partner can make 3♥!

Here is a better hand for South.

<table class="hand">
	<tr>
		<td>♠ KJ4<br>♥ AJ842<br>♦ 65<br>♣ 872</td>
	</tr>
</table>

Suppose North opens the bidding 1♠, South raises to 2♠, and North invites game by bidding 3♣.

<table class="auction">
	<tr>
		<th>North</th>
		<th>East</th>
		<th>South</th>
		<th>West</th>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>1♠</td>
		<td>Pass</td>
		<td>2♠</td>
		<td>Pass</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>3♣</td>
		<td>Pass</td>
		<td>?</td>
		<td></td>
	</tr>
</table>

The clubs are weak, so if club strength was the only factor in deciding whether to accept the invitation, South would sign off. However, with 9 high-card points, plus 1 dummy point for the doubleton diamond, South has enough strength to accept any game try North makes. Even if the hands don't fit well together, there should be at least 25 combined high-card points - enough for 4♠.

Here is one final hand for South.

<table class="hand">
	<tr>
		<td>♠ T83<br>♥ K52<br>♦ KQ94<br>♣ 875</td>
	</tr>
</table>

North opens the bidding 1♥, South raises to 2♥, and North makes a game-try with 3♣.

<table class="auction">
	<tr>
		<th>North</th>
		<th>East</th>
		<th>South</th>
		<th>West</th>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>1♥</td>
		<td>Pass</td>
		<td>2♥</td>
		<td>Pass</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>3♣</td>
		<td>Pass</td>
		<td>?</td>
		<td></td>
	</tr>
</table>

Responder has 8 points, right in the middle of the range for the 2♥ bid. South's clubs are weak, but the diamond honors could be useful. Bidding 4♥ looks like a slight overbid, but if South signs off in 3♥, North-South could miss a good 4♥ contract. The solution is for South to bid 3♦, showing the diamond strength. North can bid game if the diamond honors are useful.

### Summary

A simple raise of opener's major suit is a common auction. Knowing when to try for game and how to do so will make your constructive bidding more accurate.

## Questions

### 01

You are South. Both sides are vulnerable.

<table class="hand">
	<tr>
		<td>♠ AQT73<br>♥ 92<br>♦ A4<br>♣ AQT2</td>
	</tr>
</table>

<table class="auction">
	<tr>
		<th>North</th>
		<th>East</th>
		<th>South</th>
		<th>West</th>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td></td>
		<td></td>
		<td>1♠</td>
		<td>Pass</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>2♠</td>
		<td>Pass</td>
		<td>?</td>
		<td></td>
	</tr>
</table>

#### Suggested Answer

**3♣**

With 16 high-card points plus 1 length point for the five-card spade suit, South has enough strength to try for game. A 3♣ bid by South shows length in clubs and interest in game. North will know to value club honors highly after the 3♣ bid.

### 02

You are South. East-West are vulnerable, and North-South are not.

<table class="hand">
	<tr>
		<td>♠ Q76<br>♥ J83<br>♦ KT62<br>♣ J94</td>
	</tr>
</table>

<table class="auction">
	<tr>
		<th>North</th>
		<th>East</th>
		<th>South</th>
		<th>West</th>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>1♥</td>
		<td>Pass</td>
		<td>2♥</td>
		<td>Pass</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>3♣</td>
		<td>Pass</td>
		<td>?</td>
		<td></td>
	</tr>
</table>

#### Suggested Answer

**3♥**

The 3♣ game-try asks South to bid 4♥ with a maximum for the 2♥ bid or to sign off in 3♥ with a minimum. With only 7 points, South has a minimum, and South's club holding does not suggest accepting the invitation.

### 03

You are South. Neither side is vulnerable.

<table class="hand">
	<tr>
		<td>♠ J<br>♥ AKJ873<br>♦ Q742<br>♣ AQ</td>
	</tr>
</table>

<table class="auction">
	<tr>
		<th>North</th>
		<th>East</th>
		<th>South</th>
		<th>West</th>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td></td>
		<td>Pass</td>
		<td>1♥</td>
		<td>Pass</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>2♥</td>
		<td>Pass</td>
		<td>?</td>
		<td></td>
	</tr>
</table>

#### Suggested Answer

**4♥**

South has 19 points: 17 high-card points plus 2 length points for the six-card heart suit. Even opposite a minimum raise to 2♥ - 6 points - South has the values for game. South knows Where and How High the partnership belongs and can simply bid 4♥.

### 04

You are South. North-South are vulnerable, and East-West are not.

<table class="hand">
	<tr>
		<td>♠ K7<br>♥ QJT83<br>♦ AQJ5<br>♣ 52</td>
	</tr>
</table>

<table class="auction">
	<tr>
		<th>North</th>
		<th>East</th>
		<th>South</th>
		<th>West</th>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td></td>
		<td></td>
		<td>1♥</td>
		<td>Pass</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>2♥</td>
		<td>Pass</td>
		<td>?</td>
		<td></td>
	</tr>
</table>

#### Suggested Answer

**Pass**

Despite the strong diamond suit, with only 13 high-card points plus 1 length point for the five-card heart suit, South does not have enough strength to try for a game contract. Bidding 3♦ would show a stronger hand.

### 05

You are South. Both sides are vulnerable.

<table class="hand">
	<tr>
		<td>♠ QT4<br>♥ 73<br>♦ KJ32<br>♣ Q875</td>
	</tr>
</table>

<table class="auction">
	<tr>
		<th>North</th>
		<th>East</th>
		<th>South</th>
		<th>West</th>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td></td>
		<td></td>
		<td></td>
		<td>Pass</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>1♠</td>
		<td>Pass</td>
		<td>2♠</td>
		<td>Pass</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>3♦</td>
		<td>Pass</td>
		<td>?</td>
		<td></td>
	</tr>
</table>

#### Suggested Answer

**4♠**

South has 8 high-card points plus 1 dummy point for the doubleton in hearts. South is near the maximum for the raise to 2♠, and ♦K-J-3-2 is a useful holding in light of North's 3♦ game try. South can bid 4♠ in comfort.

### 06

You are South. Neither side is vulnerable.

<table class="hand">
	<tr>
		<td>♠ T76<br>♥ A83<br>♦ AJ952<br>♣ 65</td>
	</tr>
</table>

<table class="auction">
	<tr>
		<th>North</th>
		<th>East</th>
		<th>South</th>
		<th>West</th>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>1♥</td>
		<td>Pass</td>
		<td>2♥</td>
		<td>Pass</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>2♠</td>
		<td>Pass</td>
		<td>?</td>
		<td></td>
	</tr>
</table>

#### Suggested Answer

**4♥**

South's spades do not suggest accepting the invitation to game. However, with 10 points - 9 high-card points, plus 1 dummy point for the doubleton in clubs - South is at the very maximum for the raise to 2♥. South's overall strength makes it acceptable to bid 4♥ over any game try.

### 07

You are South. North-South are vulnerable, East-West are not.

<table class="hand">
	<tr>
		<td>♠ Q4<br>♥ KQT832<br>♦ AJ8<br>♣ K6</td>
	</tr>
</table>

<table class="auction">
	<tr>
		<th>North</th>
		<th>East</th>
		<th>South</th>
		<th>West</th>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td></td>
		<td></td>
		<td>1♥</td>
		<td>Pass</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>2♥</td>
		<td>Pass</td>
		<td>?</td>
		<td></td>
	</tr>
</table>

#### Suggested Answer

**3♥**

With 15 high-card points plus 2 length points for the six-card heart suit, South has enough strength to try for a game contract. There is no suit South wishes to emphasize, so South can make a general invitational bid with 3♥.

### 08

You are South. Neither side is vulnerable.

<table class="hand">
	<tr>
		<td>♠ Q63<br>♥ 762<br>♦ 854<br>♣ KQ93</td>
	</tr>
</table>

<table class="auction">
	<tr>
		<th>North</th>
		<th>East</th>
		<th>South</th>
		<th>West</th>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>1♠</td>
		<td>Pass</td>
		<td>2♠</td>
		<td>Pass</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>3♣</td>
		<td>Pass</td>
		<td>?</td>
		<td></td>
	</tr>
</table>

#### Suggested Answer

**4♠**

South has only 7 points - toward the minimum for the 2♠ raise - but all South's honors are in the suits bid by North. South's useful holdings in spades and clubs suggest accepting the invitation by bidding 4♠.

### 09

You are South. East-West are vulnerable, North-South are not.

<table class="hand">
	<tr>
		<td>♠ QT52<br>♥ AK82<br>♦ 952<br>♣ Q4</td>
	</tr>
</table>

<table class="auction">
	<tr>
		<th>North</th>
		<th>East</th>
		<th>South</th>
		<th>West</th>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>1♠</td>
		<td>Pass</td>
		<td>2♠</td>
		<td>Pass</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>3♦</td>
		<td>Pass</td>
		<td>?</td>
		<td></td>
	</tr>
</table>

#### Suggested Answer

**3♥(3♠)**

South has 8 points, in the middle of the 6-10 point range for the raise to 2♠. The weak diamonds are a negative factor, and South might bid only 3♠, but South's strong hearts might be useful. South lacks the strength to jump to 4♠, but South can bid 3♥, giving North one more chance to bid game.

### 10

You are South. Neither side is vulnerable.

<table class="hand">
	<tr>
		<td>♠ 7<br>♥ AQJ54<br>♦ AJ83<br>♣ KJ2</td>
	</tr>
</table>

<table class="auction">
	<tr>
		<th>North</th>
		<th>East</th>
		<th>South</th>
		<th>West</th>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td></td>
		<td></td>
		<td>1♥</td>
		<td>Pass</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>2♥</td>
		<td>Pass</td>
		<td>?</td>
		<td></td>
	</tr>
</table>

#### Suggested Answer

**3♣(3♦)**

South has 17 points, enough strength to try for game. Normally South would bid the longest side suit to invite game, but with this hand 3♣ might be a better call. Club honors will be helpful, and over 3♣, North might be able to bid 3♦ with strength in diamonds.
