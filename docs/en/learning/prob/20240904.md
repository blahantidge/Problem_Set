Today's quiz is based on Audrey Grant Improving Your Judgment 1: Opening the Bidding - Strong Unbalanced Opening Bids.

<Badge type="danger" text="Bid"/>

## Introduction

### Strong Unbalanced Opening Bids

After opening an artificial strong 2♣, if opener rebids a suit rather than notrump, it is a forcing bid.

The style for some partnerships is that the auction must then continue until at least game is reached.

A more common agreement is that, if responder makes a negative rebid and opener merely rebids the long suit, responder can pass. If opener shows a second suit, responder must keep the biding going to at least game.

<table class="hand">
	<tr>
		<td>♠ AQ9<br>♥ AKQJ85<br>♦ KQ6<br>♣ J</td>
	</tr>
</table>

For example, with this hand, you open 2♣ and responder bids 2♦, waiting. You then show the strong two-bid in hearts by bidding 2♥.

<table class="auction">
	<tr>
		<th>North</th>
		<th>East</th>
		<th>South</th>
		<th>West</th>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td></td>
		<td></td>
		<td>2♣</td>
		<td>Pass</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>2♦</td>
		<td>Pass</td>
		<td>2♥</td>
		<td>Pass</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>?</td>
		<td></td>
		<td></td>
		<td></td>
	</tr>
</table>

If responder then makes a negative rebid of 3♣ and the partnership uses the cheaper minor suit available at the three level as negative, rebid 3♥. This is no longer forcing and responder can pass with a very weak hand. Some partnerships use the cheapest bid in notrump by responder as negative.

<table class="auction">
	<tr>
		<th>North</th>
		<th>East</th>
		<th>South</th>
		<th>West</th>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td></td>
		<td></td>
		<td>2♣</td>
		<td>Pass</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>2♦</td>
		<td>Pass</td>
		<td>2♥</td>
		<td>Pass</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>3♣</td>
		<td>Pass</td>
		<td>3♥</td>
		<td>Pass</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>Pass</td>
		<td>Pass</td>
		<td></td>
		<td></td>
	</tr>
</table>

If responder makes a positive bid, either immediately in response to the 2♣ opening or after hearing opener's rebid, the partnership is committed to the game level.

A simple raise of opener's suit, for example, shows some values so the partnership is headed for a least game and perhaps a slam. Once the trump suit has been agreed, the partnership's normal slam bidding methods, such as Blackwood and control-bidding, come into effect.

<table class="auction">
	<tr>
		<th>North</th>
		<th>East</th>
		<th>South</th>
		<th>West</th>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td></td>
		<td></td>
		<td>2♣</td>
		<td>Pass</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>2♦</td>
		<td>Pass</td>
		<td>2♥</td>
		<td>Pass</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>3♥</td>
		<td>Pass</td>
		<td>?</td>
		<td></td>
	</tr>
</table>

Responder can show support for opener's suit and a weak hand by jumping directly to the game level. It would say, "I have support for your hearts but nothing else that would be of value... no ace, no king, no singleton, and no void. If you want to bid slam, you're on your own."

<table class="auction">
	<tr>
		<th>North</th>
		<th>East</th>
		<th>South</th>
		<th>West</th>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td></td>
		<td></td>
		<td>2♣</td>
		<td>Pass</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>2♦</td>
		<td>Pass</td>
		<td>2♥</td>
		<td>Pass</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>4♥</td>
		<td>Pass</td>
		<td>?</td>
		<td></td>
	</tr>
</table>

The guideline for opening 2♣ is about 22 or more points. However, other factors can affect the decision on whether to open 2♣. Here are a few tips to improve your judgment.

#### Tip #1 - Offensive Tricks

An unbalanced hand should have good playing-trick potential to be opened 2♣. Ideally, you should be within one trick of game.

Consider this hand with 22 high-card points plus 1 length point for the five-card club suit.

<table class="hand">
	<tr>
		<td>♠ AQ84<br>♥ Q<br>♦ AKQ<br>♣ AJ843</td>
	</tr>
</table>

Despite the strength, there are only five sure tricks, and it wouldn't be a good idea to open 2♣. If partner bids 2♦, you don't want to rebid 3♣ with such a meager suit. Open 1♣. If partner can't respond over that, it's unlikely your side has a game.

Now consider this hand with 18 high-card points plus 2 length points for the six-card spade suit.

<table class="hand">
	<tr>
		<td>♠ AKQT93<br>♥ AKQ4<br>♦ 3<br>♣ 42</td>
	</tr>
</table>

Hands with 12-21 points are usually opened at the one level so it would seem this is a straightforward 1♠ opening bid. Yet, this is a much better hand than the previous one to open 2♣. If the missing spades and hearts are reasonably evenly divided among the other three hands, you can likely take ten tricks with no high-card help from partner. You would hate to be passed out at 1♠.

#### Tip #2 - Defensive Tricks

To open 2♣, you should have some aces and kings that will take tricks even if you are defending.

Look at this hand.

<table class="hand">
	<tr>
		<td>♠ A<br>♥ AKQJT8<br>♦ AK84<br>♣ KQ</td>
	</tr>
</table>

This hand has offensive potential and should produce at least 10 tricks with hearts as trumps. It also has defensive potential if the opponents were to compete. You would expect to take 5 or 6 tricks if the opponents were to bid 4♠, for example. Open 2♣.

Contrast the previous hand with this one.

<table class="hand">
	<tr>
		<td>♠ <br>♥ KQJT8765<br>♦ QJT97<br>♣ </td>
	</tr>
</table>

With this hand, you can take ten tricks by yourself if allowed to play in a heart contract. But you have no sure tricks on defense if the opponents compete in spades or clubs. Don't open 2♣. Open 1♥ or 4♥ depending on your partnership style and try to buy the contract at a suitable level.

#### Tip #3 - 4-4-4-1 Hands

Strong hands with 4-4-4-1 distribution are awkward to bid. With no five-card suit, they are difficult to treat as unbalanced. Because of the singleton, you can't usually treat them as balanced.

Consider this hand.

<table class="hand">
	<tr>
		<td>♠ AQJ8<br>♥ AQ84<br>♦ J<br>♣ AKJ4</td>
	</tr>
</table>

Despite the 22 high-card points, the bidding is likely to become awkward if the hand is opened 2♣ since there is no suitable rebid. You may need to go slowly to find a fit. Open 1♣ and hope partner responds.

This hand has a similar challenge with 22 high-card points.

<table class="hand">
	<tr>
		<td>♠ AK53<br>♥ A<br>♦ AJT4<br>♣ AQ83</td>
	</tr>
</table>

There is a significant difference, however. The singleton ♥A.

Most players today would open 2♣, treating the hand as balanced and rebidding 2NT after a 2♦ response. In fact, it has become increasingly popular to treat hands with a singleton ace or even a singleton king or queen as balanced at every notrump level when there is no other palatable alternative.

## Questions

### 01

You are South. Both sides are vulnerable.

<table class="hand">
	<tr>
		<td>♠ AKJT974<br>♥ AKJ<br>♦ KQ<br>♣ 3</td>
	</tr>
</table>

<table class="auction">
	<tr>
		<th>North</th>
		<th>East</th>
		<th>South</th>
		<th>West</th>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td></td>
		<td></td>
		<td>?</td>
		<td></td>
	</tr>
</table>

#### Suggested Answer

**2♣**

With 21 high-card points plus 3 length points for the seven-card suit, open with 2♣, planning to show a strong two-bid in spades.

### 02

You are South. Both sides are vulnerable.

<table class="hand">
	<tr>
		<td>♠ T5<br>♥ AKQT83<br>♦ AKQ9<br>♣ 8</td>
	</tr>
</table>

<table class="auction">
	<tr>
		<th>North</th>
		<th>East</th>
		<th>South</th>
		<th>West</th>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td></td>
		<td></td>
		<td>?</td>
		<td></td>
	</tr>
</table>
	
#### Suggested Answer

**2♣**

There are only 18 high-card points, but you can expect to take 10 tricks with hearts as trumps with almost no help from partner, and the hand has defensive values.

### 03

You are South. Both sides are vulnerable.

<table class="hand">
	<tr>
		<td>♠ KQ85<br>♥ K<br>♦ KJ652<br>♣ AKQ</td>
	</tr>
</table>

<table class="auction">
	<tr>
		<th>North</th>
		<th>East</th>
		<th>South</th>
		<th>West</th>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td></td>
		<td></td>
		<td>?</td>
		<td></td>
	</tr>
</table>

#### Suggested Answer

**1♦**

Lots of points but they aren't working well together. This hand isn't balance and isn't a strong two-bid in diamonds. Start slowly.

### 04

You are South. Both sides are vulnerable.

<table class="hand">
	<tr>
		<td>♠ AK75<br>♥ AQJ3<br>♦ 4<br>♣ AKJ4</td>
	</tr>
</table>

<table class="auction">
	<tr>
		<th>North</th>
		<th>East</th>
		<th>South</th>
		<th>West</th>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td></td>
		<td></td>
		<td>?</td>
		<td></td>
	</tr>
</table>

#### Suggested Answer

**1♣**

Despite all the points, you don't have a strong two-bid in any suit. If partner can't bid over 1♣，it's unlikely you have a game. 

### 05

You are South. Both sides are vulnerable.

<table class="hand">
	<tr>
		<td>♠ KQJ9876<br>♥ <br>♦ KQJT4<br>♣ 7</td>
	</tr>
</table>

<table class="auction">
	<tr>
		<th>North</th>
		<th>East</th>
		<th>South</th>
		<th>West</th>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td></td>
		<td></td>
		<td>?</td>
		<td></td>
	</tr>
</table>

#### Suggested Answer

**1♠ (4♠)**

You can take 10 tricks in your own hand but don't have a single sure trick on defense, so this hand doesn't qualify as a strong two-bid. The hand won't get passed out if you open 1♠.

### 06

You are South. Your side is vulnerable and the opponents are not.

<table class="hand">
	<tr>
		<td>♠ <br>♥ AKQ5<br>♦ A85<br>♣ AKJ983</td>
	</tr>
</table>

<table class="auction">
	<tr>
		<th>North</th>
		<th>East</th>
		<th>South</th>
		<th>West</th>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td></td>
		<td></td>
		<td>2♣</td>
		<td>Pass</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>2♦</td>
		<td>Pass</td>
		<td>?</td>
		<td></td>
	</tr>
</table>

#### Suggested Answer

**3♣**

Your original 2♣ bid said nothing about clubs. You have to rebid 3♣ to show your suit. You plan to show hearts next.

### 07

You are South. Your side is vulnerable and the opponents are not.

<table class="hand">
	<tr>
		<td>♠ KQ<br>♥ AKQJ976<br>♦ <br>♣ AK83</td>
	</tr>
</table>

<table class="auction">
	<tr>
		<th>North</th>
		<th>East</th>
		<th>South</th>
		<th>West</th>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td></td>
		<td></td>
		<td>2♣</td>
		<td>Pass</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>2♦</td>
		<td>Pass</td>
		<td>?</td>
		<td></td>
	</tr>
</table>

#### Suggested Answer

**2♥**

There's no need to jump to game with this hand. The 2♥ rebid is forcing. Leave lots of room to explore for slam.

### 08

You are South. Your side is vulnerable and the opponents are not.

<table class="hand">
	<tr>
		<td>♠ 4<br>♥ AK5<br>♦ AKJT873<br>♣ AJ</td>
	</tr>
</table>

<table class="auction">
	<tr>
		<th>North</th>
		<th>East</th>
		<th>South</th>
		<th>West</th>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td></td>
		<td></td>
		<td>2♣</td>
		<td>Pass</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>2♦</td>
		<td>Pass</td>
		<td>?</td>
		<td></td>
	</tr>
</table>

#### Suggested Answer

**3♦**

Show your suit. Partner may become declarer in diamonds!

### 09

You are South. Your side is vulnerable and the opponents are not.

<table class="hand">
	<tr>
		<td>♠ AKJ83<br>♥ A<br>♦ 3<br>♣ AKJ954</td>
	</tr>
</table>

<table class="auction">
	<tr>
		<th>North</th>
		<th>East</th>
		<th>South</th>
		<th>West</th>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td></td>
		<td></td>
		<td>2♣</td>
		<td>Pass</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>2♦</td>
		<td>Pass</td>
		<td>?</td>
		<td></td>
	</tr>
</table>

#### Suggested Answer

**3♣**

Show the longer suit first. Later, bid and rebid the spades.

### 10

You are South. Your side is vulnerable and the opponents are not.

<table class="hand">
	<tr>
		<td>♠ AKJ96<br>♥ AKQ82<br>♦ 3<br>♣ AJ</td>
	</tr>
</table>

<table class="auction">
	<tr>
		<th>North</th>
		<th>East</th>
		<th>South</th>
		<th>West</th>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td></td>
		<td></td>
		<td>2♣</td>
		<td>Pass</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>2♦</td>
		<td>Pass</td>
		<td>?</td>
		<td></td>
	</tr>
</table>

#### Suggested Answer

**2♠**

The guidelines with a choice of suits to bid are the same as when opening at the one level. Rebid 2♠, the higher-ranking of the two five-card suits. If responder makes a negative rebid, show the second suit by bidding 3♥. Responder can't pass this bid, even with no points, since the partnership is now committed to the game level.
