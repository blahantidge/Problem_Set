You are sitting South. West leads the ♥A and wins the first trick as East plays the ♥9. West continues with the ♥K, which wins the second trick as East plays the ♥2, finishing an encouraging high-low attitude signal. West now plays the ♥Q, and East discards a low club. You ruff with a low spade. Find a way to make the contract.
