You are sitting South. West has led the ♣9. Let's assume you play low from dummy and win the first trick with the ♣Q in your hand. Suppose you decide to start drawing the defenders' trumps by leading the ♠K. West plays low, and East wins the trick with the ♠A. East now leads a heart. Find a way to make the contract.
