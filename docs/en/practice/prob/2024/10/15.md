You are sitting South. You lead the ♦6. A low diamond is played from dummy and partner wins the first trick with the ♦A as declarer follows with a low diamond. Partner returns the ♦8 and you win the ♦K as both declarer and dummy follow suit again. You switch to the ♣10, declarer plays dummy's ♣Q, and partner wins the ♣A. Next, partner switches to the ♥9 and declarer wins with the ♥A. Declarer now leads the ♠9. Find a way to defeat the contract.
