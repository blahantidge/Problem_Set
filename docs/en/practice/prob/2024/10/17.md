You are sitting South. West has led the ♥2. You play low from dummy and East plays the ♥K. You hold up. East returns a heart and, this time, you have to win the ♥A. You play one of your high clubs and both defenders follow suit with low clubs. You continue with another high club and, this time, West shows out, discarding a low spade. Find a way to make the contract.
