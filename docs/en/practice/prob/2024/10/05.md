You are sitting South. You lead the ♣K. A low club is played from dummy, partner plays the ♣9 and declarer follows with the ♣5. You play the ♣Q, partner finishes the encouraging attitude signal by playing the ♣4, and declarer ruffs this trick. Declarer plays the ♦4 to dummy's ♦K as both you and partner follow with low diamonds. Declarer next leads the ♥4 from dummy. Partner follows with the ♥2 and, after a moment's thought, plays the ♥Q. Find a way to defeat the contract.
