You are sitting South. Partner leads the ♥5. The ♥6 is played from dummy. The ♥8 is enough to force declarer to win with the ♥A if declarer wants to win the trick. Declarer chooses to win the ♥A. Declarer leads a low club to dummy's ♣A as both you and partner follow with low clubs. Declarer then leads the ♦J from dummy. Find a way to defeat the contract.
