You are sitting South. West has led the ♠4. You play low from dummy, East plays the ♠7, and you win the ♠K. There is no harm in taking the diamond winners. Both defenders follow to the ♦A. Both defenders also follow to the ♦Q. On the third round of diamonds, West follows but East shows out, discarding a spade. On the last diamond, East discards another spade and West discards a low club. You come to your hand with the ♥A. Find a way to make the contract.
