You are sitting South. West has led the ♣J. You play low from dummy at trick one. East wins the ♥J. East next plays the ♥A, winning the second trick. East continues with the ♥2, and West wins the trick with the ♥K. West takes a fourth trick with the remaining heart, the ♥9. You discard low spades from both hands, as East discards a low diamond. West now leads the ♠J. You play low from dummy and win the trick with the ♠K. Find a way to make the contract.
