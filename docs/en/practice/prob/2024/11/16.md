You are sitting South. West has led the ♠2. You play the ♠9 from dummy, and it wins the first trick as East follows with a low spade. You play a diamond from dummy and finesse the ♦Q. It wins. You take a trick with the ♦A. Both defenders follow with low diamonds. You lead your third diamond and ruff it in the dummy. Both defenders follow suit. Find a way to make the contract.
