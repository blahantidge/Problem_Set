You are sitting South. West leads the ♥A, you play a low heart from dummy, and East shows out, discarding a low diamond. West continues with the ♥K, winning the second trick. East discards a low club. West now leads a third round of hearts and, as you feared, East ruffs this with a low spade. There goes your ♥Q. East returns a diamond, and you win the trick with the ♦Q. Find a way to make the contract.
