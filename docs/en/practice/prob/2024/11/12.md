You are sitting South. You lead the ♠2. Declarer plays the ♠4 from dummy. Partner plays the ♠10. That wins the trick as declarer follows with the ♠5. Partner continues with the ♠K, winning the second trick as declarer plays the ♠9, and you and dummy follow with low cards. Partner leads another spade, and declarer plays the ♠A. You send a suit preference signal by playing the ♠Q rather than the ♠8. Declarer now leads the ♦4. Find a way to defeat the contract.
