You are sitting South. West has led the ♥K. You play dummy's singleton ♥10. East plays the ♥9, and you ruff with a low spade. You play a spade to dummy's ♠K, and both defenders follow suit. The ♠A drops East's ♠Q. You play a club to the ♣K. Both defenders follow suit, but no ♣Q appears. Find the safest way to make the contract.
