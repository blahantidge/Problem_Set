You are sitting South. West has led the ♠Q. It wins the trick as East makes an encouraging attitude signal with the ♠9. West continues with the ♠J as East finishes the encouraging high-low signal by playing the ♠4. West plays a third spade, and East wins this trick with the ♠K. East switches to a low club, and you win a trick with dummy's ♣K. Find a way to make the contract.
