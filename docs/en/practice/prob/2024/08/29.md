You are sitting South. You lead the ♥K. Declarer plays a low heart from dummy, and partner plays the ♥A on your ♥K. Declarer follows with a low heart, and partner has won the first trick. Partner returns the ♥J, and declarer follows with another low heart. You overtake partner's ♥J with the ♥Q. You continue with the ♥10. Partner discards a low club while both dummy and declarer have to follow suit. Find a way to defeat the contract.
