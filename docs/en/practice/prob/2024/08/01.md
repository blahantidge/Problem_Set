You are sitting South. West has led the ♦4, you play low from dummy, and East wins the ♦A. You follow with the ♦5. East leads back the ♦8. You win the ♦K as West follows with the ♦2 and dummy with the ♦9. You play the ♣Q. Both defenders follow suit. You continue with a club to dummy's ♣K. East follows suit, but West shows out. Find a way to make the contract.
