You are sitting South. Partner leads the ♠5. Declarer plays the singleton ♠6 from dummy. You play the ♠Q and declarer wins the trick with the ♠A. At trick two, declarer switches to the ♦Q. Partner follows with the ♦2, and the ♦3 is played from dummy. You win the ♦K. When defending a notrump contract, returning partner's suit is the normal action unless there is clearly something better to do. With dummy out of spades, there doesn't seem to be any reason to go against the guideline. Which spade are you leading to the next trick? Declarer plays the ♠9, and partner wins the ♠10 as dummy discards a low club. Partner continues with the ♠K. Which spade are you following?
