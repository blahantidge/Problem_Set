You are sitting South. West has led the ♥4. Going with odds, you play low from dummy. Unfortunately, East wins the ♥J. East takes a trick with the ♥A. East leads another heart and West wins the ♥K as dummy's ♥Q falls. West takes a trick with the defenders' last heart. You discard spades from both hands as East also discards an encouraging-looking spade. West shifts to the ♠J. You choose to win with the ♠A in your hand. You lead the ♣K and East wins the ♣A. East leads a spade, driving out dummy's ♠K as West follows with a low spade. Find a way to make the contract.
