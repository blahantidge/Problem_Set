You are sitting South. West has led the ♦A. That wins the first trick as East makes an encouraging attitude signal with the ♦10. West continues with the ♦Q which wins the second trick as East finishes the encouraging high-low in diamonds. West now switches to the ♥J. You win the ♥Q in dummy as East plays the ♥9. You lead the ♠10 from dummy and, when East follows with a low spade, you play low. Unfortunately, the finesse loses to West's ♠K. West continues with another heart. You win the ♥K. You play a spade to dummy's ♠Q. West follows suit, but East shows out, discarding a club. You continue with another spade, drawing West's last trump as East discards another club. Given that West started with a doubleton heart. Find a way to make the contract.
