You are sitting South. Partner leads the ♠A. A low spade is played from dummy. With a doubleton spade, you play the ♠9 as the start of an encouraging high-low attitude signal. Declarer follows with a low spade. Partner continues with the ♠K. Dummy's ♠Q is played, you finish the high-low signal in spades, and declarer follows with another low spade. Partner continues with the ♠J. Instead of ruffing in dummy, declarer discards a low club. Find a way to defeat the contract.
