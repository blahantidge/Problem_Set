You are sitting South. West has led the ♦3, and you win the first trick with dummy's ♦K as East follows with a low diamond. You lead the ♣Q from dummy. East wins the trick with the ♣A. East switches to the ♠8. You naturally win the trick with the ♠J. Unfortunately, West shows out on this trick. You takes a trick with the ♦A, and both defenders follows with low diamonds. You lead a diamond and ruff with dummy's low spade. Both defenders follows, but no ♦Q appeared. Find a way to make the contract.
