You are sitting South. West has led the ♥A. West's ♥A wins the first trick as you play low from dummy, East plays the ♥7, and you follow with a low heart. West continues with the ♥K, winning the second trick as you play dummy's last heart, East plays the ♥5, and you follow with another low heart. West leads with the ♥Q. Find a way to make the contract.
