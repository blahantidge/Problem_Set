You are sitting South. West has led the ♣Q. Suppose you play a low club from dummy. West's ♣Q wins the first trick as East makes an encouraging signal. West continues with the ♣J. Again you play low from dummy. East finishes the encouraging high-low signal and you ruff with a low spade. Find a way to make the contract.
