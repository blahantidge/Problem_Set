You are sitting South. West has led the ♣A. That wins the first trick as the singleton ♣9 is played from dummy, East plays the ♣6, and you follow with the ♣4. West continues with the ♣K. You ruff with the ♠7. You are a little surprised to see East follow with the ♣2. No reason to delay drawing the defenders' trumps. East follows to the first round of trumps, but West shows out, discarding a club. You draw East's remaining trump as West discards another club. Find a way to make the contract.
