You are sitting South. You lead the ♣7. A low club is played from dummy, partner plays the ♣K, which wins the trick as declarer plays a low club. Partner returns the ♣J. Declarer follows with another low club. You can afford to overtake partner's ♣J. You win the second trick. You can now lead the ♣10, squashing dummy's ♣9 and promoting the ♣8 into a winner after declarer wins the ♣A. Declarer leads the ♠5 toward dummy. Find a way to defeat the contract.
