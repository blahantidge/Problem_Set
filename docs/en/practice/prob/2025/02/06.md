You are sitting South. West has led the ♦A. You play low from dummy, and East plays the ♦9. You follow with a low diamond. West continues with the ♦K, winning the second trick. East played the ♦7, finishing an encouraging high-low signal. West continues with a third diamond and, as you feared, East ruffs with a low spade as you have to follow suit. East leads a low heart. Find a way to make the contract.
