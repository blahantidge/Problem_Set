You are sitting South. West has led the ♠K. You play low from dummy, and East plays the ♠2. You hold up winning the ♠A. West continues with the ♠Q and, this time, you have no choice but to win the ♠A as East follows with the ♠3. You play the ♣A and both defenders follow with low clubs. When you lead a club to dummy's ♣K, West shows out, discarding the ♥4. When you continue with dummy's ♣J, West discards the ♥2. You take your last club winner. East follows with the defenders' last club and West discards another heart. Find a way to make the contract.
