You are sitting South. West has led the ♣Q. Since East almost certainly holds the ♣A, play low from dummy. You don't want to "waste" the ♣K. East plays the ♣9 and you follow with a low club. West continues with the ♣J. Again, you play low, hoping East might have to play the ♣A. East plays the ♣2, finishing an encouraging attitude signal. West continues with another club. This time, there's no choice but to play the ♣K. As you expected, East wins the trick with the ♣A. East switches to a spade. Find a way to make the contract.
