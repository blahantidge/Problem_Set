You are sitting South. West has led the ♠A. You play a low card from dummy, East makes an encouraging attitude signal by playing the ♠10, and you follow with a low spade. West continues with the ♠K, winning the second trick. East plays the ♠8, finishing the encouraging high-low signal. West leads a third round of spades. East covers dummy's ♠J with the ♠Q. and you ruff with a low heart. You get to dummy with the ♦A. You lead the ♥9. Unfortunately, the finesse loses to West's ♥K. West leads back the ♦J, and you win in your hand. Find a way to make the contract.
