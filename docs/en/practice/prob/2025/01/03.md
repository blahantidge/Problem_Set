You are sitting South. West has led the ♠K. It wins the first trick as East makes an encouraging attitude signal with the ♠8. West continues with the ♠Q which wins the second trick as East finishes the encouraging high-low with the ♠7. West now switches to the ♣A, winning the third trick for the defense. East follows with the ♣2. West continues with the ♣Q and you finally win a trick with dummy's ♣K. East plays the ♣7. Find a way to make the contract.
