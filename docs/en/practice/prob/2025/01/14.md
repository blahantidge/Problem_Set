You are sitting South. Partner leads the ♣3. You win the first trick with the ♣K. Declarer follows with the ♣6. You play the ♣A, winning the second trick as declarer follows with the ♣Q. Partner and dummy follow with low clubs. You don't want to lead either a heart or a diamond away from your kings, so it seems safest to continue with another club. When you lead a club, declarer ruffs with the ♠A. Declarer starts drawing trumps by playing the ♠K. Both you and partner follow with low spades. Declarer continues drawing trumps by playing the ♠J. Both you and partner follow a second time. Declarer then leads the ♦9. When partner follows with the ♦5, declarer plays low from dummy. You win with the ♦J. Find a way to defeat the contract.
