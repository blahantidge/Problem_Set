You are sitting South. West has led the ♠4. When you play a low spade from dummy to the first trick and East plays the ♠Q, you let East win the trick. East continues with the ♠10. You have no choice but to win this trick. You lead a diamond from your hand, and West immediately wins the ♦A. You unblock one of dummy's diamonds, keeping dummy's ♦6 as a link card in case you need an entry back to your hand later. West continues with another spade. Let's assume you discard a club. You win the trick as East follows with a spade. Find a way to make the contract.
