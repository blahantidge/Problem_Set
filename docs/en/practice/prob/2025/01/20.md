You are sitting South. West has led the ♦6. You play a low diamond from dummy and East plays the ♦K. You win the ♦A. Both defenders follow when you play a low heart to dummy's ♥K. East follows when a low heart is played to the ♥A as West discards a low diamond. Find the safest way to make the contract.
