You are sitting South. West has led the ♥J and you win the first trick with the ♥A. You play a spade to the ♠K, and both defenders follow suit. You continue with a spade to dummy ♠A. West follows with the defenders' last spade and East discards a high diamond. You lead a low club to the ♣A. Both defenders follow suit. You continue with a club to dummy's ♣Q. West follows suit, but East shows out. Find a way to make the contract.
