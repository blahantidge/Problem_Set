You are sitting South. West has led the ♣A, and this wins the first trick as you follow with low clubs from each hand and East plays the ♣2. West continues with the ♣K. You and dummy follow with your remaining clubs, as East plays the ♣3. West now switches to the ♥9. You try the ♥Q but, as you feared, East wins with the ♥K. East returns the ♥J. You follow with your remaining heart, West plays the ♥2, and you win with dummy's ♥A. You lead a low spade from dummy. East plays the ♠4, and you win the ♠A as West contributes the ♠8. You continue with the ♠K. On this trick, West discards the ♣4. You lead a low spade to dummy's ♠Q, extracting East's last trump as West discards another club. Find a way to make the contract.
