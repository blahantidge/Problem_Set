You are sitting South. West has led the ♥10. West has led the ♣10. You play low from dummy, and East wins the trick with the ♣K. East continues with the ♣A, winning the second trick as West follows with the ♣9. East leads a third round of clubs, and you are relieved to see West follow with the ♣8. You might as well draw the defenders' trumps. Both defenders follow suit when you play the ♥A. When you play a second round of trumps, West shows out, discarding a diamond. You draw East's last trump with the ♥Q as West discards another diamond. Find the safest way to make the contract.
