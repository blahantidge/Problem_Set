You are sitting South. West has led the ♠️Q. It wins the trick as East makes an encouraging attitude signal with the ♠️9. West continues with the ♠️J as East finishes the encouraging high-low signal by playing the ♠️4. West plays a third spade, and East wins this trick with the ♠️K. East switches to a low club, and you win a trick with dummy's ♣️K. Find a way to make the contract.
