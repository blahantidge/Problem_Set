You are sitting South. West has led the ♥10. You play low from dummy, and East wins the first trick with the ♥A. So you have two heart tricks without needing to do any more work. East returns a heart at trick two. You play the ♠A, but only low spades appeared. You continue with the ♠K. Again, the ♠Q didn't appear, but on this trick, East discarded a low heart. You take the last heart winner. On this trick, West showed out. Both defenders followed with low diamonds when you play the ♦K. However, West showed out on the second round of diamonds, discarding a spade. Find a way to make the contract.
