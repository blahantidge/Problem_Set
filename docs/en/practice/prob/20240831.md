You are sitting South. West has led the ♦A, which wins the first trick as East makes an encouraging attitude signal with the ♦8. West leads another diamond and East plays the ♦K. You ruff this trick. You lead a low heart to dummy's ♥K. This wins the trick as both defenders follow with low hearts. Find the safest way to make the contract.
