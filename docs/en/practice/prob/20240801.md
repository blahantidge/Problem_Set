You are sitting South. West has led the ♦️4, you play low from dummy, and East wins the ♦️A. You follow with the ♦️5. East leads back the ♦️8. You win the ♦️K as West follows with the ♦️2 and dummy with the ♦️9. You play the ♣️Q. Both defenders follow suit. You continue with a club to dummy's ♣️K. East follows suit, but West shows out. Find a way to make the contract.
